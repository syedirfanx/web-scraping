    "Description": "London (CNN)It's no secret that Donald Trump is no big fan of the European Union. Over the past four years, the US President has talked positively about Brexit and claimed that the bloc was created in order to \"take advantage of the United States.\"   So it's perhaps no great surprise that several of his ambassadors to several European nations have behaved in ways that are not exactly diplomatic, in the traditional sense. Earlier this week, it emerged that Pete Hoekstra, the US ambassador to the Netherlands, hosted an event at his embassy for Forum for Democracy (FvD), a far-right, anti-immigration and anti-EU party that is gaining popularity in the country. Dutch magazine De Groene Amsterdammer, which first reported on the event, described it as a fundraiser for the party.   A US state department spokesperson told CNN that this event was not a fundraiser, but a \"town hall discussion and Q&A session\" with FvD. They added that during his stint in the Netherlands, Hoekstra has hosted \"15 town halls with eight different parties,\" suggesting that this event with FvD was nothing unusual.  Not everyone agrees. Read More\"Hosting a political party event, fundraiser or not, you can see it as political support from the United States for a particular point of view. Normally, diplomacy is about government-to-government interactions, not promoting particular viewpoints and giving the impression of having political allies,\" said Marietje Schaake, a former Dutch MEP and international policy director at the Stanford Cyber Policy Center. JUST WATCHEDUS ambassador's 'fake news' claim backfiresReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHUS ambassador's 'fake news' claim backfires 01:38 \"The Trump administration has shown time and again that its allies are the Euroskeptics like [Nigel] Farage and FvD, not the governments of the day,\" Schaake added.   Hoekstra is just one of a number of divisive ambassadors appointed in Europe by Trump who appear to be eroding trans-Atlantic ties, enraging their hosts and representing Trump's personal interests in Europe.  \"Europe has traditionally been a place where political appointees go, but usually it's understood that they represent the US government,\" said Tyson Barker, a former US State Department official in the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs. \"What we have seen since 2016 is people representing Trump and his personal interests, rather than the US.\"   CNN recently reported that Woody Johnson, Trump's ambassador to UK, was being investigated after allegations that he'd used his position to lobby for the British Open golf tournament to be held on one of Trump's golf courses. Asked about the specific allegations, Johnson did not deny them and called it an \"honor of a lifetime\" to serve as ambassador. After the publication of CNN's report, Johnson tweeted, \"I have followed the ethical rules and requirements of my office at all times.\" Trump said he \"never spoke to Woody Johnson about doing that.\"Johnson has also been open in his support of Brexit, suggesting it presents an opportunity for the UK and the US to grow closer, claiming this would strengthen Britain's hand when dealing with the EU.    This pattern has also been noticed in Germany, where former ambassador Richard Grenell waded into territory that diplomats traditionally avoid, such as tweeting that \"German companies doing business in Iran should wind down operations immediately,\" within hours of starting the job. Trump's hard line on Iran has been particularly difficult for the EU to swallow, as the nuclear deal from which Trump withdrew was originally signed under the auspices of the EU, its most significant triumph on the geopolitical stage.  Grenell also gave an interview to right-wing outlet Breitbart, where he said he wanted \"to empower other conservatives throughout Europe.\" Given the role of a diplomat is to deal with whichever government represents the country they are in, to speak so unambiguously about your political preference is highly unusual.  Under Trump's presidency, the US has also strengthened its relationship with EU countries that are generally considered to be delinquent member states, threatening the bloc's unity. Most notably, Trump praised Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban during his trip to the White House last year. Orban \"has done a tremendous job in so many different ways. Highly respected, respected all over Europe. Probably, like me, a little bit controversial, but that's OK,\" Trump said at the time.  Orban spent the past decade presiding over assaults on his nation's courts, academic institutions, central bank and press. The EU is currently investigating these assaults and could yet punish Orban by removing some of his rights at an EU level.  US ambassador to Hungary to step down The message has been well and truly received in Brussels. \"Are there any EU-US relations left? The official political line is whatever the differences, there is more that unites us. But if you look at it properly, there are only divisions,\" said one senior EU official. \"Under Trump, it seems they never miss a chance to try and undermine the EU. They take radical action in areas of joint interest without consulting us, such as on Iran, moving the [US] embassy [to] Jerusalem. There is a growing sense that we simply cannot rely on the US in the same way as before,\" the official added.     In the eyes of many in Europe, the ambassadors appointed to key nations by Trump are consistent with a larger shift in EU-US relations. \"Trump and his diplomats have given the impression that they want to punish the EU for some reason or another,\" one German diplomat told CNN. \"There is a huge internal debate over whether we can collaborate with the US anymore, even if [Joe] Biden wins, because they are just too unreliable.\" The diplomat believes that the decline in relations began prior to Trump taking office. \"In my experience, many of the younger politicians now in DC have a view of foreign policy shaped by 9/11 and the war on terror, not World War Two. They don't really care about Germany or Europe anymore.\"   Barker explained that this new view of the US has changed what kind of relationship Europeans now want from the transatlantic partnership. \"The transition from Bush to Obama to Trump has solidified the European view that America can pivot dramatically every eight years. The question is, how do you safeguard against this when you know the next President could be Kid Rock?\"  JUST WATCHEDMerkel: You can't fight the pandemic with liesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMerkel: You can't fight the pandemic with lies 01:31The EU official said that calm minds in Brussels are already trying to answer that question. \"From the second we knew Trump was to be President, we started to see it as an opportunity to be more independent in certain areas like defense and geopolitics. You can see already how we are taking a dramatically different approach to China, Russia and Iran than the US.\"    None of this is to say that the EU is seeking to drift from the US, but many feel now isn't a bad time for Europe to start thinking more about itself and its place in the world.    \"I hope the relationship can be repaired, of course. The transatlantic relationship is robust. But the ability for the two sides to work together, both bilaterally and as a united front on the global stage, has been undermined by the Trump administration,\" said Schaake. \"What that's done is made the case for a more autonomous, actively geopolitical EU much more of a priority.\"   CNN contacted the US State Department to ask if it agreed or disagreed with the assertion that American diplomacy under this administration has treated the EU as less of an ally than before. It declined to comment.    The crux of the problem for many in Brussels is a growing sense that maintaining or strengthening the transatlantic alliance is less of a priority for US than American interests elsewhere in the world. There is a perception that DC now wants a more transactional relationship with Brussels, which would ultimately see Europeans defer to US priorities on trade, NATO funding and diplomacy  For a continent that has for decades relied on its bigger brother as it recovered from some of the bloodiest wars in history, that presents a potentially alarming new reality: This is it, you really are on your own.

    "Description": " (CNN)Hundreds of fossilized footprints dating back 120,000 years have been discovered in Saudi Arabia, and they might point to the earliest evidence of human movement into the region, according to a new study in Science Advances. Researchers discovered hundreds of fossilized footprints, which were exposed by sediment erosion, during a survey of an ancient lake in Saudi Arabia's Nefud Desert.In among the 376 ancient shapes discovered around Alathar lake, experts identified animal footprints, including prints belonging to horses, camels and elephants -- notable because elephants appeared to have gone extinct in the Levant about 400,000 years ago. Elephant (left) and camel (right) trackways were discovered.But more surprisingly, researchers said they discovered seven hominin footprints, which, if confirmed, could be evidence of the earliest dated evidence of the human species in the Arabian Peninsula.  'Blood amber' may be a portal into dinosaur times, but the fossils are an ethical minefield for palaeontologists\n\"We immediately realized the potential of these findings,\" Mathew Stewart, one of the study's lead authors from the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, said in a statement.Read More\"Footprints are a unique form of fossil evidence in that they provide snapshots in time, typically representing a few hours or days, a resolution we tend not [to] get from other records,\" he added. Researchers believe that the footprints date to the last interglacial period -- a time which saw humid conditions that facilitated human and animal movement across a region which was otherwise comprised of deserts. Researchers were surveying the Alathar lake in Saudi Arabia when they made the discovery.Fossil and archeological records show that these conditions aided human migration from Africa to the Levant, researchers said. \"It is only after the last interglacial [period] with the return of cooler conditions that we have definitive evidence for Neanderthals moving into the region,\" Stewart said. \"The footprints, therefore, most likely represent humans, or Homo sapiens.\"After studying the footfalls, experts believe the dense concentration of tracks suggests animals gathered around the lake as a result of dry conditions and diminishing water, while humans could have used the area for water and foraging. \"We know people visited the lake, but the lack of stone tools or evidence of the use of animal carcasses suggests that their visit to the lake was only brief,\" Stewart added.

    "Description": "Beirut, Lebanon  (CNN)Coronavirus cases have skyrocketed in Lebanon where the crisis-ridden state is now considering new lockdown measures, raising the specter of a deepening financial crunch. A combination of high infection rates, a floundering economy and renewed political turmoil could signal a new phase in the country's slew of crises which began after a popular uprising last October. In addition to a growing financial crisis, healthcare professionals are warning that Lebanon's fragile medical sector could soon be overwhelmed, leaving the country at risk of a rapidly rising death toll from Covid-19.The hospitals where Covid-19 sufferers wait for others to die before they can be put on a respiratorOn Sunday, the tiny eastern Mediterranean country reported more than 1,000 new coronavirus cases, hitting a record for a third consecutive day. Lebanon has recorded a total of 29,987 cases of the virus and 307 deaths from it since the pandemic began, according to Johns Hopkins University. Around 10% of those testing for the virus are Covid-positive, a figure that health professionals describe as \"alarmingly high.\" The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that governments maintain a positivity rate of below 5% before moving to relax social distancing measures.An Italian medic walks around the coronavirus ward of a field hospital on the Lebanese University campus in Hadath on September 8.Read More\"I am extremely worried. On which pathway are we headed?\" said Dr. Firass Abiad, manager of Beirut's Rafik Hariri University Hospital, the main public hospital treating patients of the pandemic. \"When we have this sharp rise in the number of cases the first worry of any public health official is whether this rise can overwhelm the healthcare system,\" he said. \"This is the periphery we are moving into.\"Caretaker Health Minister Hamad Hassan urged a \"total lockdown\" on Sunday, but his calls were met with resistance from other members of the cabinet of caretaker Prime Minister Hassan Diab, toppled in the aftermath of the August 4 explosion but still running Lebanon's day-to-day affairs until a new government is formed. Caretaker Interior Minister Mohammed Fahmy criticized the proposal, arguing that the Lebanese people should not be \"toyed\" with by repeated lockdowns. Any decision on proposed new restrictions has been deferred to a national coronavirus committee. Flouting social distancing measuresLebanon, which previously recorded some of the world's lowest coronavirus numbers, has seen a rapid spread of the pandemic since Beirut reopened its airport in July. The spread became rampant after an explosion at the country's main port on August 4 laid waste to several neighborhoods in Beirut, killing nearly 200 people and injuring more than 6,000 others. Beirut's once-thriving cultural community was already at breaking point. Then the blast hitWhen the virus was first detected in the capital in March, a strict and proactive lockdown successfully slowed its spread -- but tipped the country's already teetering economy over the edge, causing its currency to tank and poverty rates to soar. Left reeling from the economic downturn, many in Lebanon chalked the virus up to a \"government conspiracy\" and \"heresy.\" \"We don't have coronavirus here in Tripoli. Coronavirus is heresy,\" Marwan el-Zahed, a native of the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli told a CNN team in May, explaining his belief that politicians had \"made it up.\" Security forces man a lockdown checkpoint in Beirut on August 21.The blast that shook Beirut this summer added to feelings of mistrust towards the Lebanese government, prompting many to flout social distancing guidelines. But as the virus infects more people across the country -- including in Tripoli, which has seen some of the highest case numbers in Lebanon -- many are taking a pause. \"I'll close my shop because that's what we need,\" said Beirut shop-owner Ali Jaber. \"Better for us to eat za'atar [spice mixture] and oil for lunch than to die in hospital corridors,\" he said. \"We're in the abyss.\" Poverty rates in Lebanon have soared to over 50%, according to the World Bank. The country's currency has lost over 70% of its value and people's life savings are locked up in banks that have imposed discretionary capital controls since late 2019. The political crisis has intensified in recent days, as talks over the formation of a new government have stalled. French President Emmanuel Macron has been brokering the negotiations, in a desperate attempt to stave off full-scale state collapse, in the wake of the August explosion. Describing the country's political stalemate at a press conference on Monday, Lebanese President Michel Aoun warned that the country may \"go to hell.\" French President Emmanuel Macron plants a cedar tree in Jaj Cedars Reserve Forest, to mark Lebanon's centenary on September 1.But healthcare workers are urging the government to focus on boosting the healthcare sector, despite the maelstrom of other crises it faces. \"It would be a disaster if hospitals and the ministry of health do not impose rules for all hospitals to accept coronavirus patients and to increase their beds,\" said Aline Zakhem, assistant professor of clinical medicine and an infectious diseases specialist at the American University of Beirut's Medical Center. \"Many people are going to die because they don't have access to healthcare,\" she said. \"There's going to be whole floors, if not whole hospitals dedicated to Covid.\" Meanwhile, the shelves of shops, previously flush with goods, are emptying out, and shopowners are bracing for more uncertainty in the weeks to come. \"I've never seen days like this in my life,\" said coffee shop owner Mohammad Saab. \"My customers aren't showing up anymore. Are they scared of coronavirus? It's all so strange.\" CNN's Ghazi Balkiz in Beirut contributed to this report. "

    "Description": " (CNN)Saudi Arabia has signed a series of deals to provide more than $200 million in funding to United Nations aid agencies operating in Yemen, just days after a CNN investigation highlighted a crisis in aid funding for the war-stricken nation.The investigation revealed that support pledged to UN agencies by Saudi Arabia for Yemen had more than halved in 2020, falling from more than $1 billion to just $500 million this year. Of this amount, the UN told CNN only $23 million had so far come through its appeal.The King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre (KSrelief) announced the additional Saudi funding in a televised statement Friday.\"Today, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, represented by the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre (KSrelief), signed three important agreements with UN organizations, namely the World Food Programme (WFP), the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNHCR for a total of $204 million,\" said KSrelief's Supervisor General, Dr. Abdullah Al Rabeeah.\"The amount was pledged by the Kingdom to support the Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan 2020, and the Kingdom hopes that these UN organizations will do their utmost to implement these programs as soon as possible,\" he added.Read MoreThe $204 million in funding announced by KSrelief on Friday will form part of the $500 million originally pledged by the Kingdom during a conference hosted by the United Nations and Saudi Arabia in June of this year, $300 million of which was promised to UN agencies.The funds announced Friday will all go toward the UN Humanitarian Response Plan, with the lion's share -- $138 million -- allocated to the WFP, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).A further $46 million has been allocated to WHO and $20 million to the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, leaving $94 million of the $300 million pledged to UN agencies to be finalized, OCHA said.Kuwait also pledged $20 million at a high-level UN meeting on Yemen held Thursday but it is not yet clear how the funds will be allocated, according to OCHA. \"We welcome these developments and continue to urge all donors to fulfill their pledges and increase their support, given the increasingly desperate situation on the ground,\" an OCHA spokeswoman said.Funding shortfallsCNN's report, published Tuesday, revealed the devastating impact of funding cuts to humanitarian aid organizations in Yemen by the United States, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, which have pushed the war-torn country ever closer to the brink of famine.A spokesperson for KSrelief told CNN at the time that the country had been ready to fulfill its unmet funding commitments to Yemen in July, but was waiting to finalize agreements with the agencies, citing concerns over appropriation of aid by the Iran-backed Ansarullah -- known as Houthi rebels.\"Previously, there were concerns about the lack of funding, but now we can assume that with the arrivals of the funds this afternoon, the UN organizations will begin to implement their programs tomorrow, now that the money is available,\" Al Rabeeah said Friday.\"I can assure you that the funds will be transferred today and that I do not anticipate any delays,\" he added.The UN Financial Tracking Service (FTS) has since updated the total amount received from Saudi Arabia to $231.1 million in funding to its Yemen humanitarian response plan. However, according to data from the FTS, there is still more than $214 million in unmet funding commitments to Yemen from Saudi Arabia.In Yemen, 80% of the population is dependent on aid, but UN data has revealed billions of dollars in funding shortfalls this year alone. The WFP also estimates that more than 66% of people in Yemen are considered \"food insecure\" and that more than 14 million of them could die if they are no longer able to access food assistance from aid groups operating in the country.     According to KSrelief, Saudi authorities will be \"closely following up\" the situation in Yemen to ensure that humanitarian programs are being funded to help those most in need.\"We pray that these programs will be beneficial,\" Al Rabeeah added.The US, Saudi Arabia and UAE\u00a0are key actors in the conflict in Yemen, and in 2018 and 2019 they were the biggest donors to the UN response in Yemen. In 2019, the US contributed almost $1 billion to the UN appeal, but this year, it has donated less than half that so far, giving $411 million, UN data shows. Despite the US' sizeable cut in funding, it is still the biggest donor\u00a0to the UN's Yemen appeal.A spokesperson for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) told CNN that the country would resume all operations in the Houthi-controlled north \"when we are confident that our partners can deliver aid without undue Houthi interference and account for US assistance.\"     The Houthis have\u00a0placed\u00a0harsh restrictions on UN agencies trying to access parts of the country it controls in the north. Tensions have been high since the World Food Program, along with the US and its allies, accused the Houthis of stealing food aid from other parts of Yemen.The\u00a0Houthi rebels overthrew the internationally recognized government of President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi in 2015. A Saudi-led coalition, in which the UAE is a key partner, has waged a campaign against the Houthis for the past five years, destroying much of the Houthi-controlled areas with US backing. Previous CNN investigations have shown that the US government profited from the war, by\u00a0selling\u00a0Saudi Arabia and the UAE American-made bombs and armaments."

    "Description": " (CNN)\"Hotel Rwanda's\" Paul Rusesabagina appeared in court in Rwanda for a second time seeking bail after he was arrested and charged with terrorism earlier this month.He appeared before the Nyarugenge intermediate court Friday in the capital, Kigali, where a judge ruled that a decision will be made on his bail application October 2.Rusesabagina, 66, was appealing against last week's ruling to remand him for 30 days.His lawyers, Emelin Nyembo and David Rugaza, told the court that Rusesabagina should not be tried for crimes committed by the MRCD party, a coalition of opposition parties. The group's military wing, FLN, is accused of several attacks on Rwandan territory in 2018.JUST WATCHEDShocking twist for Hotel Rwanda heroReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHShocking twist for Hotel Rwanda hero 10:12Rusesabagina faces 13 charges related to terrorism, and is accused of being the \"founder, leader and sponsor of violent, armed, extremist terror outfits,\" Rwandan authorities have said.  Read MoreHe admitted to the court that he was a member of the MRCD and that general decisions were taken under the leadership of all parties, with each party having different functions.He said, \"MRCD was a coalition of four opposition political parties, my own party PDR-Ihumure was in charge of diplomatic mission, CNRD party was in charge of military operations hence forming military wing (National Liberation Front-FLN), others had other responsibilities.\"Son of arrested 'Hotel Rwanda' film hero says his father is only guilty of 'having the guts to speak up'\"The FLN was an armed group with specific role, mine was different. I was in charge of diplomacy,\" he added. At a hearing on September 17, the judge said the court had analyzed all 13 charges against Rusesabagina and concluded that there were compelling reasons to remand him for 30 days.His lawyers questioned the jurisdiction of the court to try their client, saying he is  a citizen of Belgium, with residence in the United States. It is a sentiment echoed by his family. His daughter Carine Kanimba told CNN that he has no right to be put on trial as a Rwandan, as a Belgian citizen. \"We do not accept this whole attempt at pretending that this is a fair trial. We are begging the international community to help us. We are worried that they will kill him and they have already silenced him. The pictures we saw of him in court told us that he is frail and weak,\" she said. Kanimba said that a Belgian diplomat was able to visit her father, but that Rwandan officials were present.There are also questions about how Rusesabagina came to be in Rwanda. His family believes he was kidnapped from Dubai in late August. In a video interview with the New York Times on September 15, Rusesabagina said he was supposed to go on a private plane to Burundi to speak to churches on August 28, but when he woke up, he was in Rwanda surrounded by soldiers.Longstanding Kagame critic Rusesabagina gained prominence for saving hundreds of Rwandans during the country's genocide by sheltering them in the hotel he managed. His story was made into the Hollywood film \"Hotel Rwanda,\" starring Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo.Rusesabagina and his supporters have long maintained that he became a target of Rwandan President Paul Kagame's government after sustained criticism of the government and the conduct of the Rwandan Patriotic Front in ending the genocide in 1994.Around 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed in the genocide, which was led by Hutu extremists.  He is the recipient of several human rights awards for his efforts during the genocide, including the US Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005 and the Human Rights Prize by the Lantos Foundation in 2011, among others. Rusesabagina also holds Belgian citizenship, according to a government source in Belgium. Crackdown on oppositionRusesabagina has not lived in Rwanda since 1996, when he survived an assassination attempt. While widely praised for transforming Rwanda in the aftermath of the genocide, Kagame has also faced widespread criticism for human rights abuses and a crackdown on opposition. Rwanda accuses a pastor's daughter of treason and espionage. Her family says the charges are fabricatedOpposition politicians in Rwanda have often found themselves jailed on what they say are trumped-up charges for standing against Kagame in polls. In one of the more widely publicized cases, Diane Rwigara and her mother were jailed when the former attempted to run for president in the same election as Kagame in 2017. Diane Rwigara was acquitted of all charges including insurrection and forging of documents in 2018. Victoire Ingabire, the leader of the FDU-Inkingi party, was jailed in 2010 for charges that included collaborating with a terrorist organization, \"divisionism,\" \"minimizing the genocide\" and \"genocide ideology.\" She had returned to the country from the Netherlands to contest in the 2010 presidential elections after years of living abroad but was barred from running, and served eight years of a 15-year prison sentence before receiving a presidential pardon in 2018.

Canada's Thanksgiving falls on October 12.The exponential growth of new cases is now of grave concern to public health officials trying to avoid a second lockdown. Read MorePublic Health Agency of Canada reported a near tripling of cases in the last five weeks, with young people under the age of 40 contributing the majority of cases. \"Canada is at a crossroads with the Covid-19 epidemic trajectory,\" Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam said in a statement Wednesday. \"Unless public health and individual protective measures are strengthened and we work together to slow the spread of the virus, the situation is on track for a big resurgence in a number of provinces.\"The health agency reported Thursday that the national daily case count continues to increase, with an average of 1,144 cases reported daily during the past seven days. That average was just 380 in mid-August. Dr. Tam emphasized that Canadians can still prevent a rapid resurgence of the virus. \"As I have said, local public health authorities cannot do this alone, individual actions to prevent exposure  and limit the number of close contacts are a must. This is not simply a matter of resources, it is a reality of the current level of accelerated growth,\" she said in a statement.  'Not a time for austerity'The Trudeau government and several provincial leaders have indicated that targeted restrictions may be needed but they fear a second lockdown could put a fragile economic recovery in jeopardy. Earlier Wednesday, Trudeau's government delivered its Speech from the Throne, designed to set out its priorities for the upcoming parliamentary session. The prime minister outlined a pandemic response with the mantra, \"This is not a time for austerity.\" Trudeau promised to create a million jobs for Canadians through a mix of programs including subsidizing wages, skills retraining and incentives for businesses to hire new employees, especially in environmentally focused sectors.  In addition, Trudeau said he will continue to provide income support for the unemployed, including making it easier to qualify for unemployment and a new benefit for those who do not qualify. He also promised to help provinces now facing challenges with testing, long-term health care for seniors and school reopenings. Canada has reported more than 150,000 cases of Covid-19 with 9,295 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins global tracker."

China went ahead and built islands anyway: Since 2014, China has turned numerous obscure reefs and sandbars -- far from its shoreline -- into man-made artificial islands heavily fortified with missiles, runways and weapons systems, prompting outcry from the other governments.The US and its allies have pushed back by sailing warships through the South China Sea close to features claimed or occupied by China, in what it calls freedom of navigation operations (FONOPS). They say such patrols enforce the right of free passage in international waters; China argues these are violations of its sovereignty. The Chinese-controlled artificial island of Mischief Reef in the South China Sea, as seen by CNN from a US reconnaissance plane on August 10.But things are escalating now: The US has stepped up its challenges this year; it formally rejected China's claims as illegal, and sanctioned dozens of Chinese companies for building the artificial islands. In July, two US Navy aircraft carriers conducted joint military drills in the sea for the first time in six years -- a strong show of force. All this has sparked Chinese fury and escalated tensions; China launched a series of ballistic missiles into the sea, with state-run media warning that \"China does not fear a war.\"Why this matters: Under international law, whoever owns the contested string of islands in the sea will have the rights to all the resources in its nearby waters like fish, oil and gas. More broadly, whoever controls this sea will also hold power over one of the world's most valuable trading routes -- it hosts one third of all global shipping.JUST WATCHEDWhy it matters who owns the seasReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhy it matters who owns the seas 03:48What's the deal with Taiwan?Taiwan is a self-governing democratic island of around 24 million people, which split from mainland China in 1949 after the end of a bloody civil war.China insists Taiwan is its territory: Authorities in Beijing claim full sovereignty of Taiwan, even though Taiwan has never been controlled by China's ruling Communist Party. The two sides have been governed separately for more than seven decades. For years, Beijing has attempted to impose diplomatic, trade and military pressure on Taipei, marginalizing it in the international community -- for instance, China has successfully blocked Taiwan from joining global agencies like the World Health Organization. What this means for other countries: Most countries abide by China's demand that Taiwan not be recognized as an independent nation, publicly observing Beijing's view there is \"one China\" -- though many governments also maintain close unofficial ties with Taiwan.Things escalated this summer: Recent months have seen a warming relationship between the US and Taiwan -- much to China's ire. Two high-profile US officials visited Taiwan in the space of two months, in a symbolic show of support by the Trump administration. In August, the US also sold 66 fighter jets to Taiwan, the biggest arms sale to the island in years.In response, China carried out a series of military drills and aircraft incursions in the waters and airspace near Taiwan -- marking a significant escalation in tensions. Chinese officials warned in September that \"China firmly opposes any form of official exchanges between the United States and Taiwan.\" Some have also hinted at the threat of sanctions against US officials. President Xi has been clear in his ambitions to \"reunify\" the island with the mainland, and has refused to rule out the use of force. Recent military drills were described in Chinese state media as a \"rehearsal for a Taiwan takeover\" and threats of invasion have increased sharply as tensions with the US rise.JUST WATCHEDDecoding the China-Taiwan relationshipReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHDecoding the China-Taiwan relationship 02:24Why are China and India clashing in the Himalayas?The China-India conflict is centered around a long-disputed border in the Himalayas.After fighting a bloody border war in 1962, the two countries drew up a loosely-defined demarcation line called the Line of Actual Control (LAC).But they disagree on its location: Though the LAC shows up on maps, the two nuclear powers do not agree on its precise location and both regularly accuse the other of overstepping it, or seeking to expand their territory.      They have an uneasy status quo: The countries signed a series of agreements in the 1990s to try to keep the peace, including an agreement that neither side shall open fire within 2 kilometers (1.24 miles) of the LAC. But things got ugly this year: This June saw the bloodiest Sino-Indian clash in more than 40 years. Troops at the border fought with fists and stones, in a brawl that killed at least 20 Indian soldiers; China didn't acknowledge any casualties. Both sides accused the other of overstepping the border.Things heated up in September after each side accused the other's troops of firing warning shots. It's believed to be the first time shots have been fired along the border since 1975.Where things stand now: Officials are now in de-escalation talks; in late September, both sides agreed to stop sending troops to the border, and to strengthen communications. But a meaningful peacekeeping mechanism could be a long way off -- partly because of the increasingly assertive foreign policy on both sides.Why is China fighting Japan over a few tiny islands?Both China and Japan have claimed a rocky, uninhabited island chain in the East China Sea as their own.Located 1,200 miles (1,900 kilometers) southwest of Tokyo, the islands are known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan and the Diaoyu Islands in China. The islands are also claimed by Taiwan, where they are known as the Tiaoyutai islands.  The overlapping claims: Both China and Taiwan say their claims to the island chain extend back to the 1400s, when it was used as a staging point for Chinese fisherman. However, Japan says it saw no trace of Chinese control of the islands during an 1885 survey, so it formally recognized them as Japanese sovereign territory in 1895. The US occupation of Japan after World War II complicated things -- but the islands were eventually returned, and Japan has administered them since the 1970s.Why this matters: The area has much-coveted resources; it holds a rich fishing ground, and recent surveys suggest that the waters around the islands may contain oil and natural gas deposits.A Japanese military plane flies over the Senakuku/Diaoyu islands in this file photo.How things escalated: China and Japan have engaged in tit-for-tat struggles for years, with the issue escalating sharply in September 2012 after the Japanese government formally purchased the islands from their private Japanese owner. This resulted in some of the largest protests seen in major Chinese cities in decades. Tensions rose again this June after a Japanese city council bill asserted that \"the islands are part of Japanese territory.\"China, meanwhile, has flexed its military muscles; Japan announced in June that Chinese government ships have been spotted in waters near the islands every day since April. And in July, Chinese coast guard ships intruded into Japan's territorial waters multiple times, forcing the Japanese coast guard to block them from approaching Japanese fishing boats.The number of warplanes from China's People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) flying close or around Japan's southwest air zone, which includes the contested island chain, has also increased exponentially in recent years, according to Japan's Air Self Defense Force (JASDF). Where things stand now: The two countries have stepped up their rhetoric; Japan has lodged diplomatic protests, and China has accused Japan of infringing on its sovereignty. The escalation this summer has raised international alarm; under a mutual defense pact with Tokyo, the US is obligated to defend the islands as part of Japanese territory.What's going on in Hong Kong?The semi-autonomous Chinese city of Hong Kong was plunged into a political crisis in 2019 as anti-government protests brought much of the territory to a standstill. Protesters had many complaints, including alleged police brutality and limited democratic freedoms -- but at the heart of it all is the city's conflicted relationship with the central government in Beijing.Is Hong Kong part of China? Yes -- but as a former British territory, it was granted freedoms of press, speech, and assembly when it was handed back to China in 1997. Hong Kong also has its own legal and political systems, currency and trade. These freedoms stand in stark contrast to China's authoritarian leadership and strict censorship.\n\n\n\n So what's the conflict? Under the handover agreement, Hong Kong is supposed to keep its limited autonomy until 2047 -- but many Hong Kongers say China is violating that promise and encroaching on their freedoms. This fear was heightened by a controversial extradition bill last year, which kicked off the protests and was later scrapped.Meanwhile, China has criticized the movement as a threat to security and stability. Some protesters have also called for Hong Kong independence, and asked other countries for assistance, which China condemned as an unacceptable challenge to its national sovereignty.How things escalated: In June, China cracked down by imposing a national security law for Hong Kong, entirely bypassing the city's own legislature. Details of the law weren't released to the public until it had passed.China said the law, which grants Beijing sweeping new powers, is necessary to curb unrest; critics say it's a devastating blow for Hong Kong's freedoms.Where things stand now: The law has already been used to make numerous arrests; for instance, several people were arrested in September for using protest slogans, which are now criminalized. Those convicted under the law could face sentences of up to life in prison.Since it came into force, political parties have disbanded, protest signs were pulled down across the city, and Hong Kongers are fleeing to seek asylum or refuge in other countries.JUST WATCHEDActivists are fleeing Hong Kong, once a safe havenReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHActivists are fleeing Hong Kong, once a safe haven 03:22"

    "Description": " (CNN)China gained the \"understanding and support\" from the World Health Organization before starting a controversial emergency use program for its Covid-19 vaccine candidates, a Chinese health official said Friday.China has been administering experimental coronavirus vaccines to hundreds of thousands of people since July under an emergency use program approved by the Chinese government, before their safety and efficacy have been fully proven by clinical trials.Some experts and vaccine developers in the West have warned against the premature authorization of coronavirus vaccines before last-stage trials are completed.Zheng Zhongwei, an official with China's National Health Commission, said Friday that China's cabinet, the State Council, approved a trial plan for the emergency use of Covid-19 vaccines at the end of June.\"After the approval, we communicated and informed the relevant representatives from the WHO office in China and gained the understanding and support of the WHO,\" he told a news conference.Read MoreAt a media briefing on Friday, Dr. Mari\u00e2ngela Sim\u00e3o, the WHO's assistant director-general for access to medicines and health products, said: \"Countries have autonomy according to their national regulations and legislations to issue emergency use authorizations for any health product, and China and other countries have already done so for different products. And WHO has emergency use listing provisions and has issued already several products for diagnostics.\"China has been one of the biggest players in the global race to develop a coronavirus vaccine. It currently has 11 vaccines in clinical trials and four in Phrase 3 trials. Globally, there are 38 vaccines in human trials, among which nine have reached the last stage of testing, according to the WHO.Last month, Zheng revealed in an interview with state broadcaster CCTV that China had been using experimental coronavirus vaccines on people in \"high risk\" professions since July 22.Workers at high risk of exposure to the virus -- including frontline medical personnel, epidemic prevention personnel, medical staff at fever clinics, and customs and border personnel -- were eligible to receive the vaccine, he said in the interview.Inside the company at the forefront of China's push to develop a coronavirus vaccineThe vaccines, which have not completed Phase 3 trials, were developed by the state-owned China National Biotec Group Corporation, known as Sinopharm.In a statement posted on Sinopharm's website this month, the company said its two vaccine candidates had been administered \"hundreds of thousands of times\" under the emergency use program approved by the government.The vaccines were used on medical professionals, diplomats deployed to high-risk countries, and state-owned company employees working overseas under China's Belt and Road Initiative, according to the firm's general counsel Zhou Song. \"There was not a single case that demonstrated significant negative effects, nor was anyone infected,\" Zhou said in the statement.Phase 3 trials for Sinopharm's vaccines are being conducted in the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Peru, Morocco, and Argentina.Last week, the UAE approved the emergency use of a Sinopharm vaccine for frontline workers, according to the country's health ministry.A vaccine candidate in Phase 3 trials developed by Sinovac Biotech, another Chinese pharmaceutical company, is also included in China's emergency use program, according to Reuters.The program comes after the Chinese government approved the use of a different vaccine candidate for the country's military in June."

We're thrilled to celebrate his life-saving devotion by awarding him the PDSA gold medal,\" PDSA's Director General Jan McLouglin said in a virtual presentation of the medal, which was specially designed to fit on Magawa's work harness.The PDSA Gold Medal, part of the organization's Animal Awards program, is \"the highest honor for outstanding animal bravery and exceptional dedication in civilian life,\" according to its website.African giant pouched rats are intelligent and easy to train, according to the press release; Magawa began training from a young age, and \"passed all his tests with flying colors\" before being deployed to Cambodia.He has been trained to ignore scrap metal lying about, and signals to his handler when he detects a landmine's exact location.

The US alone dropped 2.7 million tons of ordnance -- including cluster bombs and submunitions -- over a four-year carpet-bombing campaign in Cambodia. Up to a quarter of the cluster bombs failed to explode, meaning they stayed active and dangerous but out of sight, according to a 2019 report by the US Congressional Research Service.Then, after the fall of the Khmer Rouge, the ensuing civil war and Vietnamese invasion saw more landmines laid across the country. The PDSA estimates that there are still three million unexploded landmines in Cambodia. Some reports estimate that only half the country's land has been cleared so far, according to the congressional report."

    "Description": "New York (CNN Business)Apple users are still awaiting the unveiling of the iPhone 12, after the tech giant introduced only new iPads, Apple Watches and a new services bundle at its virtual event last week.Wall Street analysts are betting that Apple (AAPL) will hold another event to introduce the next iPhone in coming weeks, with the new devices hitting shelves some time in mid-October. During the company's most recent earnings call in July, executives acknowledged that the new iPhone would go on sale several weeks later than last year's late September sale date. That's left more time for Apple fans to obsess over what features the newest iPhone may contain. Expectations are high \u2014 the iPhone 12 could prompt a \"supercycle\" of device upgrades, analysts say, as users clamor to get what is widely anticipated to be the first 5G iPhone. Here's what else analysts predict users may see from the new iPhone: So, we are getting a 5G iPhone, right? Read MoreAnalysts think the answer to that question is a resounding yes.\"Investors are heavily expecting a 5G iPhone,\" said DA Davidson analyst Tom Forte. This will be a big deal for Apple, which is late to the 5G phone game, trailing competitors including Motorola (MSI), Samsung (SSNLF) and others that have released 5G devices. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives estimates that roughly 350 million iPhones could be upgraded within the next year to 18 months. While many consumers have been keeping their phones longer before upgrading to a new device, connection to the faster, next generation wireless networks would be a big selling point. But, it's possible that not all models of the iPhone 12 will connect to the fastest 5G networks. Where is the iPhone 12?The basic iPhone 12 model may connect only to low- and mid-band 5G networks (which are faster than 4G networks but don't bring the superfast speeds 5G is known for), while the higher-end models will likely connect to the very fastest \"millimeter wave\" 5G networks, according to Moor Insights and Strategy analyst Anshel Sag. That's because connecting a phone to the fastest 5G networks requires  additional parts, making it more expensive to produce. \"I would be shocked if they came out with millimeter wave just for the base model,\" Sag said. Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan said Apple may even choose to make only the highest end iPhone 12 connect to millimeter wave 5G.  In any case, Apple will likely release US- and non-US versions of the 5G iPhones, according to Wedbush's Ives, since network technology can vary from country to country. What if I don't care about 5G? You could still be in luck. Analysts say Apple could release a 4G version of the iPhone 12, or a new 4G version of the lower-priced iPhone SE that launched earlier this year \u2014 it's just not clear when. DA Davidson's Forte said he thinks the lowest-price option in the iPhone 12 lineup released this fall could be a 4G model. Others, including Ives and Sag, said a new 4G iPhone is more likely to hit the market in the first half of next year, at a lower price point than its 5G counterpart. How many models will there be? Apple typically releases multiple versions of each new iPhone (last year there were three). Analysts expect that this year, Apple will unveil either three or four versions of the iPhone 12. Ives has written that he expects to see four iPhone 12 models, including one with a larger, 6.7-inch display.If Apple does release four models of the new iPhone, one of them could also be the smallest iPhone Apple has produced, both Sag and Mohan said.  \"There's a pretty large audience that continues to gravitate towards the smallest iPhone,\" he said. \"It's really just a question of whether Apple thinks the market is big enough to make it worth it.\" How much will I be shelling out? Good question. \"Pricing is always the biggest unknown when it comes to Apple,\" Mohan said. Last year, the iPhone 11 (starting at $699) was Apple's cheapest new smartphone since the iPhone 8. The iPhone 12 feature that could help convince millions of people to upgrade their phonesThis year, the price of the highest-end iPhone 12 model will likely go up by around $100, to account for the cost of adding the superfast 5G connectivity, Mohan said. As for the lower-end models, multiple analysts agreed that Apple is likely to try to keep the prices relatively consistent with last year. However, DA Davidson's Forte also noted that after releasing the lower-priced iPhone SE earlier this year, the company may not feel the need to offer a bargain version of the 12 this fall. What else will I get?When it comes to battery life, most analysts don't expect any major changes. However, Mohan said that in the highest-end version of the iPhone 12 \u2014 expected to be the largest model and have millimeter wave 5G connectivity \u2014 Apple may use that extra space to beef up the battery. Connecting to the fastest 5G networks could be a battery drain, and this would help boost the value of the device. As for the camera, Apple is expected to include a LiDAR sensor on the camera module of at least some iPhone 12 models, as it did with the iPad Pro earlier this year. The feature would improve camera focus in dark rooms, and make artificial reality services \"much more accurate and useful,\" Sag said. Forte added that the iPhone maker may also integrate new video capability, a feature that could capitalize on the new 5G connectivity.There are also rumors about a high-refresh-rate screen, which would make the phone seem significantly faster. One thing iPhone 12 buyers may not get: A charging block. Since most iPhone owners already have the block that plugs into the wall, several analysts said they think Apple may ship the new iPhone with only a charging cord. It could be an environmentally friendly move, and save Apple a few dollars per iPhone. \"It just goes to show how much cost pressure is on the business when you're trying to incorporate new features,\" Mohan said. \"Where are you going to cut costs and not upset a consumer? This could be one of those instances.\""

It could be an environmentally friendly move, and save Apple a few dollars per iPhone. \"It just goes to show how much cost pressure is on the business when you're trying to incorporate new features,\" Mohan said. \"Where are you going to cut costs and not upset a consumer? This could be one of those instances.\""

    "Description": "New York (CNN Businesss)Amazon is the latest tech giant to throw its weight behind a \"Netflix for video games\" service. After months of rumors, it's venturing into cloud gaming with a platform called Luna.Luna is both software and an optional $49.99 physical controller that can connect to a Fire TV, PC, Mac and mobile devices. People can sign up for early access Thursday and invites will start going out mid-October. The service works a bit like Amazon Prime Video or Twitch, offering an interface with channels you can subscribe to individually for separate monthly fees. So far, Amazon has only announced the price of a \"Luna+\" channel, which costs $5.99 a month and will include games like \"Resident Evil 7,\" \"Control\" and \"Panzer Dragoon.\" Amazon is also offering an Ubisoft channel offering games like \"Assassin's Creed Valhalla,\" for a price that's yet to be announced. Amazon hasn't announced any exclusive partnerships or games yet.The mechanics of play will impress anyone who has dreaded long download times or run out of storage space on their console. When you open the Luna app or web page, it lets you play games immediately after selecting them. You won't have to download a game directly to your device or own any specialized hardware. Amazon said it wants to create an easy way to game and simplify consumers' options.Read More\"Our vision is that for too long, it's been a little bit too complicated to game. It's too expensive. And so Luna is our answer to that and helps customers to take out all of the complexity so that they can just play,\" Gabi Knight, director of Luna, told CNN Business.The Luna service joins the ranks of competitors including Sony's PlayStation Now service that has been around since 2014, and newer offerings like Google Stadia and Microsoft's Project xCloud. All of these services have seen some user adoption but haven't truly become mainstream yet and the best business model has yet to emerge.Amazon knows that it is one of the last tech giants to the party.\"We're not the first people to start in cloud gaming but we really want to take this early access period to listen, to really invite people to help us build the future of cloud gaming,\" said Knight.Amazon's new offering could help raise more awareness and push the trend toward cloud gaming, but will it be able to stand out from the pack?From its controller-focused hardware offering to its instant streaming gameplay, Luna perhaps most resembles Google Stadia. But while Google has several pricing tiers, Amazon's pay-per-channel model shakes things up, and it argues that it could make it more accessible to people unfamiliar with cloud gaming. \"Amazon is able to do better than Google in that they can drive really low prices,\" said Joost van Dreunen, founder of video game investment firm New Breukelen, adding that Google charges consumers $10 a month and that model doesn't include all the games. \"What Amazon can do is buffet style. Six bucks and off you go, have fun with it.\"Amazon could further differentiate itself from Google and other rivals, including the console makers, by leaning into its gaming ecosystem. It already owns the dominant livestreaming platform, Twitch, the booming cloud business Amazon Web Services which powers many notable games and a still-developing game studio. In fact, Luna will feature Twitch streamers playing its games and Twitch will feature links to Luna games, allowing Amazon to leverage Twitch's hundreds of millions of viewers and potentially turn them into customers for its budding service.\"The cool thing is you can start watching the stream and decide if that's really a game for you,\" said Knight, the Luna director. \"So we think it's really going to aid in the discovery, not only of games but also of streamers.\"Correction: An earlier version of this story gave the wrong price for Google's Stadia offering. The price is $10 a month."

    "Description": "New York (CNN Business)The United States and China have a frosty economic relationship right now -- see the TikTok asset sale drama --  and there are growing expectations that more Chinese companies with stocks trading on US exchanges will soon move their listings home.There are simply too many political risks, experts say, that are unlikely to abate even after the US presidential election. Joe Biden may show more diplomacy with regard to China if he defeats President Trump. But Biden could still take a hard line on trade and other economic issues. And Chinese companies may see listing in China or Hong Kong as a safer move.\"The Trump administration has clearly taken a much more aggressive approach to China on trade & technology issues than prior administrations,\" said Mark Mahaney, a tech stock analyst with RBC Capital Markets, in a recent report, \"but our read is that this reflects more of a generational shift among US policymakers and that a Biden administration would generally continue a similar approach.\"That's why one fund manager who covers China fears there will be even more delistings of Chinese stocks in the US -- and not just from fraudulent companies like Luckin Coffee, which was booted off the Nasdaq this year following the disclosure of massive accounting irregularities.Huawei says 'survival is the goal' as US crackdown hammers its businessRead More\"The ongoing trade war and the eroding U.S.-Chinese relationship have been a catalyst for making it less attractive for Chinese companies to seek a public listing in the United States,\" said Brian Bandsma, portfolio manager with the Vontobel Quality Growth fund, in a report this month.Bandsma said he doesn't expect that all Chinese companies trading in the US will leave the Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange. Rather, \"the U.S. markets will no longer be the default venue for Chinese companies to raise capital.\" \"The Chinese government is finally making good on promises to open up domestic markets to foreign investors. Additionally, Hong Kong and China are taking steps to make local listings more attractive, especially to high-tech startups,\" Bandsma added.He noted that Tencent has been a solidly performing stock, even though it primarily trades in Hong Kong. (Tencent (TCEHY) does have a thinly traded stock in the US on the so-called \"pink sheets.\")Ant Financial, an affiliate of Jack Ma's Alibaba, is also planning to go public in Hong Kong and Shanghai and not the US -- even though Alibaba (BABA) had a successful IPO on the NYSE in 2014. Kicked off before they decide to leave?Some Chinese companies might not have a choice about staying on Wall Street. The Senate has already passed a bill that would call for delisting Chinese stocks that don't meet certain accounting standards. It's not yet clear if the House will vote to approve it as well.But some experts fear that the growing US-China tension could eventually lead to successful Chinese companies like Alibaba to flee Wall Street, jeopardizing  America's standing as a worldwide financial leader. \"If adopted, the bill would run counter to US interests: there are high chances that Chinese companies would decide to de-list from the US and go to other stock exchanges, such as Hong Kong or London, instead,\" said Agathe Demarais, global forecasting director at The Economist Intelligence Unit, in a report. \"This would deal a blow to US dominance over global financial markets,\" she added.More bark than bite?Still, others think the tough talk in Congress and from the White House regarding China is just election season pandering. Actual trade policies won't be as severe. JUST WATCHEDWhy Trump's war on WeChat could hurt American businessesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhy Trump's war on WeChat could hurt American businesses 03:00Analysts at the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (KWEB), which owns the US-listed shares of Alibaba  as well as e-commerce rivaks JD.com (JD) and Pinduoduo (PDD) and top Chinese search engine Baidu (BIDU),  think worries about a more stringent crackdown on Chinese companies are overblown.\"We believe many of these announcements amount to pre-election posturing and any seriously confrontational policy would risk an uproar in US equity markets as a whole just before an election,\" the KraneShares analysts wrote in a report. What's more, some think that if Biden does wind up becoming the 46th president, he might pull back on some of the most punitive trade measures against China.It's one thing to maintain a tough stance with Chinese companies like TikTok owner ByteDance on intellectual property theft and other tech sector concerns, particularly privacy issues. But tariffs may not wind up being Biden's preferred way of addressing them. \"One point that may be under-appreciated about a Biden presidency is the potential for dropping tariff-based coercion against China, Europe and other trading partners,\" said Rebecca Felton, senior market strategist with RiverFront Investment Group, in a report. \" We believe that this would be a positive for the global economy.\""

    "Link": "/2019/07/20/health/iyw-cities-losing-36-million-trees-how-to-help-trnd/index.html",
    "Description": " (CNN)If you're looking for a reason to care about tree loss, this summer's record-breaking heat waves might be it.  Trees can lower summer daytime temperatures by as much as 10 degrees Fahrenheit, according to a recent study.  But tree cover in US cities is shrinking. A study published last year by the US Forest Service found that we lost 36 million trees annually from urban and rural communities over a five-year period. That's a 1% drop from 2009 to 2014. If we continue on this path, \"cities will become warmer, more polluted and generally more unhealthy for inhabitants,\" said David Nowak, a senior US Forest Service scientist and co-author of the study.  Nowak says there are many reasons our tree canopy is declining, including hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, insects and disease. But the one reason for tree loss that humans can control is sensible development. The most effective way to tackle climate change? Plant 1 trillion trees\"We see the tree cover being swapped out for impervious cover, which means when we look at the photographs, what was there is now replaced with a parking lot or a building,\" Nowak said. Read MoreMore than 80% of the US population lives in urban areas, and most Americans live in forested regions along the East and West coasts, Nowak says. \"Every time we put a road down, we put a building and we cut a tree or add a tree, it not only affects that site, it affects the region.\" The study placed a value on tree loss based on trees' role in air pollution removal and energy conservation. Why you should be forest bathing (and we don't mean shampoo)The lost value amounted to $96 million a year. Nowak lists 10 benefits trees provide to society: Heat reduction: Trees provide shade for homes, office buildings, parks and roadways, cooling surface temperatures. They also take in and evaporate water, cooling the air around them. \"Just walk in the shade of a tree on a hot day. You can't get that from grass,\" Nowak said. To get the full temperature benefit, tree canopy cover should exceed 40% of the area to be cooled, according to a recent study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \"A single city block would need to be nearly half-covered by a leafy green network of branches and leaves,\" the authors wrote.Air pollution reduction: Trees absorb carbon and remove pollutants from the atmosphere. Energy emissions reduction: Trees reduce energy costs by $4 billion a year, according to Nowak's study. \"The shading of those trees on buildings reduce your air conditioning costs. Take those trees away; now your buildings are heating up, you're running your air conditioning more, and you're burning more fuel from the power plants, so the pollution and emissions go up.\" Water quality improvement: Trees act as water filters, taking in dirty surface water and absorbing nitrogen and phosphorus into the soil. Flooding reduction: Trees reduce flooding by absorbing water and reducing runoff into streams. Noise reduction:  Trees can deflect sound, one reason you'll see them lining highways, along fences and between roads and neighborhoods. They can also add sound through birds chirping and wind blowing through leaves, noises that have shown psychological benefits. Protection from UV radiation: Trees absorb 96% of ultraviolet radiation, Nowak says. Improved aesthetics: Ask any real estate agent, architect or city planner: Trees and leaf cover improve the looks and value of any property. Improved human health:  Many studies have found connections between exposure to nature and better mental and physical health. Some hospitals have added tree views and plantings for patients as a result of these studies. Doctors are even prescribing walks in nature for children and families due to evidence that nature exposure lowers blood pressure and stress hormones. And studies have associated living near green areas with lower death rates. Wildlife habitat:  Birds rely on trees for shelter, food and nesting. Worldwide, forests provide for a huge diversity of animal life. Planning for treesGardening becomes healing with horticultural therapyNowak says there's a downside to trees too, such as pollen allergies or large falling branches in storms, \"and people don't like raking leaves.\" But, he says, there are ways cities and counties can manage trees to help communities thrive. \"You can't just say 'we're not going to have forests.' We might as well manage and work with the trees.\"\"You don't want a tree in the middle of a baseball field. It's very difficult to play sports if you have trees in the way. Or trees in the middle of freeways.\" Nowak says we can design and manage tree canopies in our cities to help \"affect the air, to affect the water, to affect our well-being.\" Urban forests especially need our help to replace fallen trees. Unlike rural areas, it is very difficult for trees to repopulate themselves in a city environment with so much pavement and asphalt.\"A lot of our native trees can't actually find a place to drop an acorn so they can regenerate,\" explains Greg Levine, co-executive director for Trees Atlanta.\"That's why the community has to go in and actually plant a tree because the areas just aren't natural anymore.\"'America's Amazon' is at risk The job is not complete when the saplings take root. Organizations like Trees Atlanta and their volunteers plan most of their year to care for these young trees until they're mature enough to thrive on their own.  \"We try to prune trees for 10 years to make sure they get a good healthy structure.\" Levine adds. \"We also add mulch around trees to help keep the moisture in the ground so the tree doesn't dry up. We have to have a lot of patience with planting trees around pavement, making sure that they can rise to the challenge. \"How you can help stop tree loss Protect what you have:  Nowak says the first step is caring for the trees on your own property. \"We think we pay for our house, and so we must maintain it. But because we don't pay for nature, we don't need to. And that's not necessarily true.\" Prune the dead limbs out of your trees:  If they're small enough, do it yourself or hire a company. The risk of limbs damaging your house is significantly lowered when there's tree upkeep, Nowak said. Notice where your trees may be in trouble: Often, you can observe when something's wrong, such as when branches are losing leaves and breaking or when mushrooms are growing at the base or on the trees. You can also hire an arborist or tree canopy expert to assess the health of your trees on an annual basis. Or you can contact your local agricultural extension office for advice. Don't remove old trees if it's not necessary:  Instead, try taking smaller actions like removing branches. \"It takes a long time for these big trees to get big: 50 to 100 years. And once they're established, they can live a long time. But taking a big tree out and saying 'we'll replant,' there's no guarantee small trees will make it, and it will take a very long time to grow.\" Allow trees to grow on your property: Although everyone's aesthetic is different, it's the cheap way to get cooler yards  and lower energy bills. It's also an inexpensive approach to flood and noise control. Nowak says he laughs when his neighbors wonder why their property doesn't have more trees, because \"I hear people running their lawn mowers.\" Fallen seeds need a chance to implant, and constant mowing prevents that. If you don't like where a seedling is growing, you can dig it up and plant it or a new tree where you like.Educate yourself about trees and get involved: Many cities have tree ordinances that seek to protect very old, significant trees. You can get involved by attending city council meetings. You can also help your city plant trees by joining local nonprofit groups.

    "Description": "Miami (CNN)In a city where \"sunny day floods\" increased 400% in a decade, rising seas are changing the old real estate mantra of \"location, location, location.\" In Miami these days, it's all about elevation, elevation, elevation.And long before melted ice caps wash over Ocean Drive, one of America's most vulnerable big cities is becoming a test case for the modern problem of climate gentrification.While some scientific models predict enough polar ice melt to bring at least 10 feet of sea level rise to South Florida by 2100, just a modest 12 inches would make 15% of Miami uninhabitable, and much of that beachside property is among America's most valuable. READ: Millions of US homes at risk of chronic flooding this century, study saysRead MoreEven now, as more frequent \"king tides\" bubble up through Florida's porous limestone, pushing fish through sewers and onto streets, residents are becoming more aware that their city is built on the rippling shelves, ridges and canyons of a fossil seabed. \"Water is simply going back to the same places it flowed ages ago,\" says Sam Purkis, Chair of the University of Miami's Geosciences Department. \"The irony is what happened 125,000 years ago is going to dictate what happens to your house now.\"The fickle undulations between city blocks could mean the difference between survival and retreat, and the rising cost of altitude is sparking a noticeable shift in community activism and municipal budgets.In Pinecrest, artist Xavier Cortada installed murals showing how many feet above sea level intersections are. Neighbors in Pinecrest formed America's first Underwater Homeowners Association (complete with elevation yard signs) and named a marine scientist as president. Miami Beach is spending millions elevating roads, upgrading pumps and changing building codes to allow residents to raise their mansions by five feet.But in working-class, immigrant neighborhoods like Little Haiti, year-to-year sea level rise gets lost in the day-to-day struggle, and most had no idea that they live a lofty three feet higher than the wealthy folks on Miami Beach. They found out when developers started calling, from everywhere. \"They were calling from China, from Venezuela. Coming here with cases of money!\" says Marleine Bastien, a community organizer and longtime resident. \"We used to think that the allure of Little Haiti was the fact that it's close to downtown, close to both airports and close to the beach. Unbeknownst to us, it's because we are positioned at a higher altitude.\"Pointing out a row of vacant shops, she ticks off the names of a dozen small business owners she says have been forced out by rising rents, and lists others who she says unwittingly took lowball offers with no understanding of Miami's housing crisis.\"If you sell your home in Little Haiti, you think that you're making a big deal, and it's only after you sell, and then you realize, 'Oh, I cannot buy anywhere else.'\"Marleine Bastien, center, protests with residents and activists against the Magic City plans.  After her community center and day school were priced out of three different buildings, she caught wind of plans to build the sprawling $1 billion Magic City development on the edge of Little Haiti, featuring a promenade, high-end retail stores, high rise apartments and imagined by a consortium of local investors, including the founder of Cirque du Soleil.Magic City developers insist that they picked the site based on location, not elevation. A view of downtown Miami and South Beach from a plane shows the oceanfront development of the past.They promised to preserve the soul of Little Haiti and give $31 million to the community for affordable housing and other programs, but it wasn't enough for Bastien. \"This is a plan to actually erase Little Haiti,\" she says. \"Because this is the one place where immigration and climate gentrification collide.\"She fought the development with all the protesters and hand-lettered signs she could muster, but after a debate that went until 1 a.m., commissioners approved the permit with a 3-0 vote at the end of June.\"The area we took was all industrial,\" says Max Sklar, VP with Plaza Equity Partners and a member of the development team. \"There was no real thriving economy around these warehouses or vacant land. And so our goal is to create that economy. \"Can we appease everybody? Not 100%, that's not feasible. It's not realistic. But we've listened to them.\" He repeats a promise to deliver $6 million to a Little Haiti community trust before ground is even broken and, as a sign that he listened to at least one demand, acknowledges that the complex will now be called Magic City Little Haiti.But while Bastien mourns the defeat, her neighbor and fellow organizer Leonie Hermantin welcomes the investment and hopes for the best. \"Even if Magic City did not come today, the pace of gentrification is so rapid that our people will not be able to afford homes here anyways,\" she says with a resigned head shake. \"Magic City is not the government. Affordable housing policies have to come from the government.\"A woman uses an umbrella for shade as she walks on a hot day in Miami.\"(Climate gentrification) is something that we are very closely monitoring,\" Miami Mayor Francis Suarez tells me. \"But we haven't seen any direct evidence of it yet.\"Suarez is the rare Republican who passionately argues for climate mitigation plans and helped champion the $400 million Miami Forever bond, approved by voters to fund action to protect the city from the ravages of higher seas and stronger storms.Miami Mayor Francis Suarez championed a plan to tackle the impact of the climate crisis.\"We actually created in our first tranche of Miami Forever, a sustainability fund for people to renovate their homes so that they can stay in their properties rather than having to sell their properties,\" he says.But that fund is a relatively small $15 million, not enough to dent a housing crisis that grows with each heat wave and hurricane, in a city where over a quarter of residents live below the poverty level. What's happening in Little Haiti could be just one example of a \"climate apartheid\" that the United Nations warns is ahead, where there will be a gulf between the rich who can protect themselves from the impact of climate change and the poor who are left behind. Philip Alston, the UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, said there was already evidence of how the climate crisis affects the rich and poor differently.And he pointed out that those hurt most were likely those least responsible. \"Perversely, while people in poverty are responsible for just a fraction of global emissions, they will bear the brunt of climate change, and have the least capacity to protect themselves,\" Alston wrote last month.

Here's how they could make a difference.

That's around 65 tons of CO2 a year per person, which is over 10 times the global average.Otto noted that because the sample in the study was small, the numbers are illustrative. \"Probably our estimates are even lower than the true emissions of millionaires,\" she said.    \"Regarding their own lifestyle choices, the rich can change a lot,\" said Otto. \"For instance, putting solar panels on the roofs of their houses. They can also afford electric cars and the best would be if they avoided flying.\"In the study, air travel accounted for more than half of the footprint of a super-rich couple.German architects  Aktivhaus say this home generates twice as much energy as it consumes.Read: Climate change: Do you know the basics?Rich people also have more flexibility to make changes. \"A high-income consumer likely has access and is able to afford more climate-friendly products or produce from local farmers,\" said Tom Bailey, who contributed to a new report that highlights consumption in high-income cities. \"High-income cities and high-income individuals also have the resources to trial new products, services and solutions,\" he explained, adding that they have the capacity to create a market for more sustainable goods. DivestmentAs well as choosing what to spend money on, rich people can choose what industries to invest in -- or not to invest in. Oxfam estimates that the number of billionaires on the Forbes list with business interests in the fossil fuel sector rose from 54 in 2010 to 88 in 2015, and the size of their fortunes expanded from over $200 billion to more than $300 billion.Steam rises from a coal-fired power plant in Germany. But there's a trend of wealthy investors selling their shares in climate-harming industries, known as divestment. Over 1,100 organizations and 59,000 individuals, with combined assets totaling $8.8 trillion, have pledged to divest from fossil fuels through the online movement DivestInvest. Among them is Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who signed the pledge on behalf of himself and his environment foundation -- as well as a group of 22 affluent individuals from the Netherlands who pledged to remove their personal wealth from the top 200 oil, gas and coal companies. Watch: Why climate change worries the world's largest companies\"You don't invest in coal, you don't invest in oil, in gas, also in some car companies that produce normal cars, or aviation, so you direct the financial flows,\" said Otto. And with divestment, a little can go a long way. \"We did some simulations that shows that with the divestment movement you don't need everyone to divest,\" said Otto. \"If the minority of investors divest, the other investors will not invest in those fossil fuel assets because they will be afraid of losing money ... even if they have no environmental concerns.\"  Wealth means power Wealthy people are not just economic decision makers, they can have political influence too. They can fund political parties and campaigns and have access to lawmakers. There is more CO2 in the atmosphere today than any point since the evolution of humansOtto argued that rich people could use their political power to instigate positive changes to climate policy.  \"Those people with the highest emissions, they have the highest agency to change something,\" said Otto. \"There's so much research about the poor, the impact of climate change on the poor ... sustainable development goals and so on. But when it comes to action and sustainability and transformation, the poor cannot do anything because they are busy surviving.\"But the educated, the rich and the super-rich -- it's a completely different case. They have the money and the resources to act and they also have the social networks,\" she explained.Fund climate researchThe wealthy can also support climate research. In 2015, Microsoft founder Bill Gates committed $2 billion of his fortune to fund research and development into clean energy. Can coral farms save our reefs?In May, a group of scientists wrote to 100 wealthy charities and families in the UK to ask for an \"extraordinary increase\" in funding for environmental and climate-related issues. \"We implore you to urgently consider significant investment to prevent further ecological catastrophe -- whether through your personal investments or your philanthropy,\" the letter said.There's plenty of incentive for the wealthy to demand climate action:  A recent UN report warned that delaying climate policies will cost the world's top companies $1.2 trillion over the next 15 years. Role models The super-rich might also have an influence on other people's carbon emissions. \"High status in our societies remains associated with high material wealth,\" said Otto. \"It's an aspiration to become like the very wealthy and you imitate the lifestyles of people who you want to be like.\"For example, air travel is no longer only a treat of the super-rich. This year, budget airline Ryanair was the only non-coal plant among Europe's top 10 emitters. Ryanair is among the EU's biggest greenhouse gas emitters, according to EU data. The rankings include power stations, manufacturing plants and aviation.\"We as a society have to search for new ways of leading 'rich' lives that are independent of material wealth,\" said Stephanie Moser, of the University of Bern, in Switzerland, who found that a person's carbon footprint is better indicated by their income than their environmental beliefs.\"We have to redefine wealth in our societies such that living a \"good life\" is possible without high greenhouse gas emissions,\" she said.

Among them is Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who signed the pledge on behalf of himself and his environment foundation -- as well as a group of 22 affluent individuals from the Netherlands who pledged to remove their personal wealth from the top 200 oil, gas and coal companies.

And with divestment, a little can go a long way. \"We did some simulations that shows that with the divestment movement you don't need everyone to divest,\" said Otto. \"If the minority of investors divest, the other investors will not invest in those fossil fuel assets because they will be afraid of losing money ... even if they have no environmental concerns.\"  Wealth means power Wealthy people are not just economic decision makers, they can have political influence too.

    "Description": " (CNN)Rich people don't just have bigger bank balances and more lavish lifestyles than the rest of us -- they also have bigger carbon footprints. The more stuff you own, and the more you travel, the more fossils fuels are burned, and the more greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere. Jetting around, buying luxury goods, keeping mansions warm and driving supercars -- they all have a carbon footprint.Oxfam has estimated that the average carbon footprint of someone in the world's richest 1% could be 175 times that of someone in the poorest 10%. Studies also show that the poor suffer the most from climate change.Read: While the rich world braces for future climate change, the poor world is already being devastated by itRead MoreBut some argue that the wealthy can do the most to help fix the climate crisis. Here's how they could make a difference. Spend wiselyThe buying decisions of the rich mean much more in the fight against climate change than those of most people.Ilona Otto and her colleagues at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research estimated that the typical \"super-rich\" household of two people (which they defined as having net assets of more than $1 million, excluding their main home) has a carbon footprint of 129 tons of CO2 a year. That's around 65 tons of CO2 a year per person, which is over 10 times the global average.Otto noted that because the sample in the study was small, the numbers are illustrative. \"Probably our estimates are even lower than the true emissions of millionaires,\" she said.    \"Regarding their own lifestyle choices, the rich can change a lot,\" said Otto. \"For instance, putting solar panels on the roofs of their houses. They can also afford electric cars and the best would be if they avoided flying.\"In the study, air travel accounted for more than half of the footprint of a super-rich couple.German architects  Aktivhaus say this home generates twice as much energy as it consumes.Read: Climate change: Do you know the basics?Rich people also have more flexibility to make changes. \"A high-income consumer likely has access and is able to afford more climate-friendly products or produce from local farmers,\" said Tom Bailey, who contributed to a new report that highlights consumption in high-income cities. \"High-income cities and high-income individuals also have the resources to trial new products, services and solutions,\" he explained, adding that they have the capacity to create a market for more sustainable goods. DivestmentAs well as choosing what to spend money on, rich people can choose what industries to invest in -- or not to invest in. Oxfam estimates that the number of billionaires on the Forbes list with business interests in the fossil fuel sector rose from 54 in 2010 to 88 in 2015, and the size of their fortunes expanded from over $200 billion to more than $300 billion.Steam rises from a coal-fired power plant in Germany. But there's a trend of wealthy investors selling their shares in climate-harming industries, known as divestment. Over 1,100 organizations and 59,000 individuals, with combined assets totaling $8.8 trillion, have pledged to divest from fossil fuels through the online movement DivestInvest. Among them is Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who signed the pledge on behalf of himself and his environment foundation -- as well as a group of 22 affluent individuals from the Netherlands who pledged to remove their personal wealth from the top 200 oil, gas and coal companies. Watch: Why climate change worries the world's largest companies\"You don't invest in coal, you don't invest in oil, in gas, also in some car companies that produce normal cars, or aviation, so you direct the financial flows,\" said Otto. And with divestment, a little can go a long way. \"We did some simulations that shows that with the divestment movement you don't need everyone to divest,\" said Otto. \"If the minority of investors divest, the other investors will not invest in those fossil fuel assets because they will be afraid of losing money ... even if they have no environmental concerns.\"  Wealth means power Wealthy people are not just economic decision makers, they can have political influence too.

They needed to know more about the state of the reef, but were coming up short. Long-term scientific monitoring had only collected detailed information on a small number of reefs -- not enough for marine park managers to form a cohesive response to climate change.\"If you want to understand where there are opportunities to respond after bleaching events, or to actually look after key areas, then we need to have information from a much greater number of reefs,\" Beeden said.\"To try to get that information ... you need to mobilize a huge workforce,\" Mumby said. \"(Scientists) don't have the resources and time to do that kind of survey.\"Ridley was looking for a project, Beeden and Mumby needed people, and so began discussions for the Great Reef Census. How it will work For several weeks late next year, anyone -- locals, tourists, fishermen, superyacht and other boat owners -- will be asked to take photos of the reef and upload them to an app. Then, anyone in the world with internet access will be invited to log on to help identify what's there. You don't need to be a coral expert to become involved. Scientists say some of the most recognizable coral species are also the most important for reef restoration.\"That includes reefs that are dominated by these big plate-like corals, which are really important in stimulating recovery,\" Mumby said. \"Also, reefs that have what we're describing as monumental corals -- coral monuments -- which are exceptionally old, long-lived corals that have survived being damaged for one reason or another.\"Plate coral on the Great Barrier Reef off Townsville, Australia. \"They're like the long, slow, old growth forests that we see in rainforests, the enormous trees,\" Beeden explained. If scientists can identify the location of corals that naturally work to regenerate the reef, they can help protect them to give the reef the best chance it has to survive the climate crisis.\"As a reef manager, there's not much you can do to stop things warming up. (But) not everywhere warms up at the same rate. If you can map where that variation exists, and find those areas that are really important for recovery ... then you're strategically managing that recovery process as best you can,\" Mumby said.'The reef is not dead'Ridley's Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef has been trying to get as many ambassadors onto the water as possible.

    "Description": " (CNN)How many of us have our best ideas on the toilet? No really, it can happen. Take Zuraina Zaharin from Malaysia. She's built a business off the back of a loo break. Not just any loo break, of course. This one was near Everest in the early 2000s when she was climbing in the region -- and it was pretty bleak.\"I was facing this problem: the toilet,\" she explains. \"It's easy for men to do their business; they can just do it anywhere. But not for the ladies. We have to wait until we find some nice spot. Even then, I can't do it. I just have to find the toilet.\"Things didn't improve upon discovering the facilities, however. \"The last toilet at Everest base camp is a pit latrine,\" Zaharin continues. \"The smell, God knows... it's so stinky.\"Zaharin had traveled to the Himalayas, only to encounter \"a mountain of poop.\"Read MoreEcoLoo co-founder Zuraina Zaharin in the Himalayas in the early 2000s. Not pictured: the dubious toilet facilities.The problem hasn't exactly gone away. In 2018, 28,000 pounds of human waste was hauled from Everest base camp during the climbing season, according to a local NGO tasked with cleaning up Everest, and dumped in open pits where it risks entering the water supply system.It was an extreme example of unsafely managed sanitation -- something 4.5 billion people have to live with, according to the World Health Organization. Even flush toilets can bring their own problems, according to the UN, potentially \"increasing water stresses\" in countries with an inadequate water supply.Zaharin, an entrepreneur, adventurer and environmentalist, did not forget her Everest experience. When she attended a business forum in 2012 and listened to a man looking for investment in a sustainable toilet, ideal for locations with poor sanitation or little water, the stars aligned.Imad Agi from Sweden conceived a waterless toilet system that turns human waste into fertilizer without the harmful germs that can cause sickness if used in agriculture -- ideal for organic farming.Agi and Zaharin went into business together as co-founders of EcoLoo, refining the toilet and taking it to market.JUST WATCHEDA  toilet for the remotest places on EarthReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHA  toilet for the remotest places on Earth 02:00The toilet works by adding a microbe solution to the waste chamber. The microbes break down human solids -- normally in three to four days -- leaving behind \"ashes,\" while liquid waste is turned into liquid fertilizer, which can be extracted via an outlet, Zaharin explains. EcoLoo recommends the microbe solution is topped up once a month and costs $60 for a year's supply.EcoLoo claims it's less energy-intensive than a regular toilet because there's no waste water to separate and process. And before you ask, no, it doesn't smell, says Zaharin -- the bacterial process prevents bad odors from building in the tank.The toilet range, priced between $800-$2,500, has gone on to win a clutch of awards and sell over 2,000 units in 21 countries. Notable examples include units installed at Petra, the UNESCO World Heritage Site in Jordan.Tourists queue outside EcoLoo cubicles at Petra, Jordan. The UNESCO World Heritage acquired the units in 2016, with local media reporting that fertilizer produced by the toilets was used in plant nurseries. Zaharin says the EcoLoo could potentially play a role in disaster relief efforts when sanitation issues, often related to contaminated water supplies, cause diseases to spread rapidly.Of course, it's not the only waterless toilet on the block. Models have been around for decades in the developed world in one shape or form, incinerating, freezing or composting waste. But EcoLoo believes its low-energy product could have wide appeal.We're using 141 billion liters of fresh water globally every day to flush toilets -- six times the daily water consumption of the population of Africa -- per one recent study. Meanwhile, \"water stress is the biggest crisis no on is talking about,\" Andrew Steer, the head of the World Resources Institute, said earlier this year.  Diarrhea linked to inadequate sanitation causes an estimated 432,000 deaths every year, says the UN.

    "Description": "Tokyo (CNN)Kristen Sorensen was 55 when she became paralyzed from the neck down last year.\"It came out of nowhere,\" says Sorensen. \"I'd been fine and exercising every day, but it just started with tingling in my fingertips then progressed.\"Diagnosed in October 2018 with Guillain Barre syndrome, a rare disorder that affects the body's nervous system, she never expected to walk again.But earlier that year, the Brooks Cybernic Treatment Center in Jacksonville, Florida, became the first US center to use a unique rehabilitative technology developed in Japan -- the Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL). HAL -- essentially a wearable cyborg -- helps those with spinal cord injuries and muscular dystrophy regain their movements and strengthen their nerves and muscles. Known as exoskeletons, they're a type of lightweight suit, with joints powered by small electric motors, that serve as mechanical muscle.Read MoreHere's what's truly mind-blowing: Patients use their brain waves to control them. When Sorensen heard about the brain wave-controlled exoskeleton, which was developed by Japanese roboticist Yoshiyuki Sankai, she knew she had to give it a try. She was determined to walk at her daughter's wedding a few months later in December. But it's not just those with disabilities or injuries who stand to benefit. By 2050, there will be more than 2 billion people over age 60, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), and exoskeletons could offer a solution to the world's aging population.   In the future, as human bodies wear down with age, an exoskeleton -- powered by active minds -- could help people stay on their feet.  With such huge potential applications available, the global medical exoskeleton market will be worth an estimated $2.8 billion by 2023, according to research company Markets and Markets. Users in the driving seatWhen Sorensen first tried HAL, she could barely move across flat surfaces.A trained physiotherapist at the Brooks Center helped her fit HAL over her waist and trousers, connecting her to sensors that help pick up faint bio-electric signals on the surface of the skin, which communicate a patient's intention to move. Once HAL receives these signals, it helps support the person's movements. Kristen Sorensen was 55 when she became paralyzed from the neck down in 2018.But you can't just put on HAL and expect to be sprinting in seconds. Rehabilitation requires time, determination and the help of a physiotherapist and a body weight harness that ensures patients are supported and kept upright while they use HAL on a treadmill. During that training, physiotherapists keep a log of each patient's motions and the settings used -- from walk to jog mode. They can monitor the user's movements and adjust the settings accordingly, so their movements come more naturally. Sorensen says it initially felt like HAL was doing most of the work by helping induce her muscles to make small leg movements that mimic natural walking patterns, but then she found herself increasingly in the driving seat. \"After the first couple times, your brain connects to HAL, and I could see I was moving my legs myself,\" she says. \"It was just incredible -- my heart was just bursting.\"\n\n\n\nKristen Sorensen was determined to walk at her daughter's wedding.\n\n\nShe overcame her paralysis by training with HAL.\n\n\n\nUsually it takes those with less severe mobility issues than Sorensen between two to 10 tries for patients to get used to HAL so that the sensors and the brain can start working together, according to Sankai. But after almost 40 training sessions, each lasting an hour-and-a-half, Sorensen was back on her feet, albeit with the support of a walker. She made it to her daughter's wedding.Currently, Sankai's exoskeletons are helping patients restore their muscle movements in Japan, the Philippines and in Germany and Poland. Tech for goodThe brain behind HAL is bespectacled billionaire roboticist Sankai. He heads up Japanese company Cyberdyne -- founded in 2004 -- where his vision has been to create these \"wearable cyborgs\" designed to \"fuse man, machine and information.\" And while the name of Sankai's firm might recall the scary Cyberdyne Technologies that created villainous robots in US science-fiction blockbuster \"Terminator,\" the Japanese roboticist wants to create tech not for war, but for peace and rehabilitation. Yoshiyuki Sankai wants to augment humanity with his exoskeleton devices. When Sankai was a 9-year-old in the 1960s, he discovered \"I, Robot\" by science fiction writer Isaac Asimov and became entranced by the positive applications of technology. He decided to pursue engineering at the University of Tsukuba in Japan. In 1998, Sankai made his first HAL prototype, which became the world's first, and spent the next decades refining the product into the sleek, lightweight version of today. Previously robotic-assistance tech centered on military use. But these days, HAL is part of a wave of research that focuses on using exoskeleton tech to treat ailments or provide support to wearers. For example, researchers at Harvard unveiled a soft exosuit in 2014 that enhances a patient's strength, much like HAL. And automobile makers like Ford are using exoskeletons on factory floors to reduce worker fatigue. HAL, too, has potential beyond the medical field, with everything from rescue and support and labor intensive factory work to entertainment and elderly care.\"The average age of workers (in Japan) is very high, so these technologies can help them and gradually increase elderly people's physical functions so they can remain independent,\" says Sankai.  But when new technologies are created there are few or no social and legal rules to regulate them. Sankai says these measures must be debated in advance so all parties involved in the manufacture and use of technologies such as exoskeletons maintain control over the development direction. Cyberdyne has two ethics committees; one dedicated to promoting research; the other on standing by the idea of peace when creating and developing new devices and technologies. Next up, Sankai and his team are collecting data on their treatment method to better improve their existing medical devices. Sankai's aim is to prepare medical devices that will maintain and increase human health for longer. For now, he is happy seeing everyone from seniors to the severely disabled regain independence. It's a thought that Sorensen shares. \"When I used HAL, there were people who came from all over the country to use the equipment,\" she says. \"I would like this kind of technology to be more readily available.\""

    "Description": " (CNN)On the eastern edge of the Himalayas, nestled between India and Tibet, lies the tiny nation of Druk Yul, better known as Bhutan. In Bhutanese, the name means \"Land of the Thunder Dragon,\" a nod to the violent storms that pound the rugged mountain peaks and flood the lush valleys. Bhutan is known as \"the last Shangri-La\" -- a remote Himalayan nation, rich in natural beauty and Buddhist culture, where national happiness is prioritized over economic growth.Fiercely proud and protective of its traditions, Bhutan has been closed to outside influences for centuries. The nation only opened its doors to tourism in the 1970s and has decided to take a unique approach to westernization, creating a concept known as the \"Gross National Happiness Index.\"Don't be fooled by the name. This is not just a measure of how much people smile and laugh. It's a holistic approach to sustainable development that gives as much weight to human flourishing as it does wealth.\"We in Bhutan are very unique; our democracy is very, very unique ... in the sense we all are grounded very strongly by our national values,\" said Bhutan Prime Minister Dr. Lotay Tshering, who took office in November 2018. \"We do not put personal interest ahead of national interest.Bhutan Prime Minister Dr. Lotay Tshering in his office.\"When we say Gross National Happiness, it is not the celebrative 'Ha ha -- Ho ho' kind of happiness that we look for in life,\" Lotay explained. \"It only means contentment, control of your mind, control of wants in your life. Don't be jealous with others, be happy with what you have, be compassionate, be a society where you can be more than happy to share.Read More\"Our king rightly calls Gross National Happiness as development with values,\" Lotay continues. \"If the policy does not have a good amount of happiness index, if the policy is not every environment friendly, if the policy will not be able to ensure that it will result in the well-being of Bhutanese, that policy will never be approved in the country.\"Gross National HappinessThe Centre for Bhutan and GNH Studies is responsible for administering Bhutan's Gross National Happiness surveys. They ask questions such as \"How happy did you feel yesterday?\" and \"How often do you practice meditation?\"They measure nine key areas of happiness every five years -- psychological well-being, health, education, good governance, ecology, time use, community vitality, culture and living standards. Two surveys have been conducted so far, in 2010 and 2015, with another one due next year.The house of a working farm sits in a valley nestled in the mountains near the eastern Bhutanese town of Paro. The 2015 survey sampled more than 7,000 Bhutanese from across the country. It yielded some interesting results.\"The harder components like living standard, health, access to health or access to education and so on, they're improving in Bhutan,\" said Tshoki Zangmo, a researcher at the Centre.\"But the softer components like psychological well-being or the trust indicator that we have in our community vitality domain, those were deteriorating,\" she added. \"The trust indicator within urban areas in the country, they were deteriorating.\"That's right. Bhutan is not the happiest country in the world. It actually ranks 95th out of 156 countries in the 2019 World Happiness Report. Much of that has to do with the nation's poverty, and the challenges of bringing economic and social equity to a predominately agricultural society. Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.Much of the rural population relies on subsistence farming in a high-mountain environment that is vulnerable to climate change. Rugged terrain, frequent floods and landslides hinder development; urban-rural connectivity is poor. Television was only introduced in 1999 and there are still no traffic lights in the capital city.\"There's another misunderstanding ... that Bhutan has claimed that we're the happiest country,\" said Tshoki. \"I don't think we're the happiest country.\"But what sets Bhutan apart from the other countries is that our vision is clear,\" she added. \"Our vision is to reach a state where societies have all the enabling conditions intact, not only the economic aspects but the other aspects as well, such as the environment, the community, having access to health and education and so on.\"Dr. Prime MinisterOne only needs to follow 50-year-old Lotay to see the Bhutanese way in action. He exercises daily, but one day is special. Every Thursday he steadily pedals up a steep hill outside Thimphu, Bhutan's capital city. His goal is the 169-foot-tall Buddha Dordenma statue, one of the largest in the world. His mission is two-fold: exercise to strengthen his body, and prayer and meditation to strengthen his mind.Prime Minister Dr. Lotay Tshering prays outside of Buddha Dordenma.\"When we say stronger, it just does not mean the muscle strength,\" Lotay says. \"It means the mental strength, the strength of your neurons. So those are the ingredients to help your neurons to be very strong.\"After his bike ride, the Prime Minister makes his way to the hospital for rounds. As a urologist and surgeon for more than 20 years, being a doctor is an integral part of what makes him happy. Therefore, he makes time on Thursdays and Saturdays to pursue his passion, which just happens to reflect his values. Bhutan's Prime Minister as a boy on his family farm.\"Since I come from a traditional family, I always thought we should help others,\" Lotay says. \"I thought being religious is the way forward, so on that note I really wanted to be a monk. My mother said why not be a doctor so that you can be really of help to the needy ones and so ... I decided to be a doctor.\"As he makes his hospital rounds with residents and interns, Lotay tries to instill the same values he has practiced, values he says he tries to bring to how he approaches two of Bhutan's top goals: universal healthcare and education.\"Health and education are the most powerful social levelers,\" the Prime Minister says. \"So based on that, we have free health and free education in our country.  While it is free, it is not easily accessible, easily available for everyone that needs the service. Tshering visits with a patient on hospital rounds.\"I thought we could improve the accessibility of health care services to especially the needy ones, those who are based in the villages,\" he said, adding that \"this pair of hands can only do so much. A surgical blade can only operate a patient at a time. \"I joined politics to see mainly if I can bring in some policy changes,\" he added, \"so that with the stroke of my surgical blade, I treat one patient. With the stroke of a pen I can treat the whole nation.\"Bhutan's futureThe country may not rank highest in happiness, yet, but it has made major gains. Thousand of kilometers of roads have been constructed and phone lines installed. Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity accounts for the largest share of its economy.Water flows through tunnels at the site of the Punatsangchhu hydro-electric power project in Wangdue, Bhutan.The World Bank calls Bhutan a developmental success story, with decreasing levels of extreme poverty and improvements in gender equality, as well as a stable political and economic environment.\"Just over the last three to four decades our life expectancy at birth has increased from near 50 to over 70,\" said Lotay. \"With modernization, with decent access to good health care, more nutritious food and health awareness being better day by day, so many Bhutanese now live longer.\"Bhutan places a tight control on tourism, including visits to the Tiger's Nest, a sacred Buddhist site on a cliffside.Due to the country's natural beauty and native culture, ecotourism is huge. To manage it within the country's Gross National Happiness mandate, Bhutan imposes an ecotourism tax of $250 a day per person, which they use to offset the environmental impact of thousands of visitors. It's been so successful that Bhutan says it's not only carbon-neutral, it's carbon-negative.The country has long partnered with the World Wildlife Fund to protect native wildlife in numerous parks. Plastic bags have been banned since 1999. Tobacco has been banned since 2005, making Bhutan the world's first smoke-free nation. The Bhutanese constitution mandates that at least 60% of the country remain under forest cover. Right now, said Lotay, they are at 70%.A monastery on a hilltop in the Haa valley, Bhutan. The valley was off-limits to tourists until 2002. Despite the need for economic growth, the Prime Minister is confident those priorities will not change for the Bhutanese people.\"When we know that monetary wealth and material wealth will not translate to what you actually want in your life ... peace of mind and happiness ... then why should we target that as our main objective?\"We have to think about the next generations to come,\" he added. \"So, these are the values of Gross National Happiness that we practice. That's why economically we may not be doing very well because all those checks and balances will ensure that whatever we initiate will be sustainable, will be for generations to come.\" CNN's Samantha Bresnahan and Sugam Pokharel contributed to this report."

    "Description": " (CNN)An ordinary workday quickly turned into a rescue mission after a bridge inspector spotted a stranded dog 120 feet above the Mississippi River.Ryan Nataluk was working alongside his crew on Sunday afternoon when Craig Jenkins, one of his bridge inspection engineers, noticed something out of the ordinary on the Natchez--Vidalia Bridge.\"Craig called over the radio, \"I see a dog!\" said Nataluk. \"We've never seen a live dog before so at first I thought it was a raccoon.\"After a second look, it was most definitely a dog that somehow managed to get stuck on a lower chord of the bridge. Nataluk described the pup as shy at first, but she eventually warmed up after realizing he was there to help.The dog found herself stranded above the Mississippi River.Nataluk, who is a vice president and lead engineer for the company Stantec, has been inspecting and climbing bridges for more than 23 years. He also spends his spare time mountain climbing. So when it came to rescuing the pup, he didn't even think twice about it.\"Read More\"I go camping and climbing all over with my family and dog,\" said Nataluk. \"I've had to bring my own dog across rivers and even haul him up peaks and  overtime I've figured out how to make makeshift harnesses.\"Little did he know, such experience would come in handy.  After alerting police, Nataluk jumped into action for the impromptu rescue. He used a piece of chord that he fashioned into a harness to make sure she would be secure. His company tweeted a video of the rescue and described the moment as being \"in the right place at the right time!\"Talk about being in the right place at the right time! Our bridge inspection crew was working over the Mississippi River this weekend when bridge inspector Craig Jenkins noticed a stranded dog beneath the bridge deck, 120ft above the river. (1/3) pic.twitter.com/ix8nTYo34q\u2014 Stantec (@Stantec) September 22, 2020 Nataluk says he climbed down onto the bridge deck and placed the dog in the harness. The video then shows him working with officer John Fenly to pull her up to safety. He says he was concerned that she may have been injured but those fears quickly subsided. \"When we got her up there she just started walking immediately and wagging her tail,\" said Nataluk. \"You could tell she was really happy.\"An officer with the Natchez police department removes the harness from around the dog.He said the crew joked about him taking her back home with him to Colorado, but fortunately someone else wanted to claim her. The Natchez Police Department said the dog was adopted soon after her rescue.\"She is a very fortunate dog,\" said Police Chief Walter Armstrong. \"They need to name her, 'Lucky.'\""

    "Description": " (CNN)Picture a robot. Did you envision a giant machine assembling cars, Data from \"Star Trek,\" C-3PO from \"Star Wars\" or \"The Terminator\"? Most of us would probably think of something massive -- or at least human size. But a whole arm of robotics is focusing on bug-size 'bots (and smaller). It's not just the size of tiny insects that are inspiring roboticists; it's also the many complex tasks and physical feats that comprise the everyday lives of many fleas, flies and other six-legged creatures. Meet the flying robot that can glide, flip and hoverThe question isn't only how big and powerful we can make a machine, but how small and savvy. What might humans be capable of if we could command a tiny army of simple machines? How could we use robots that could fly, skim across the water, hop to the ceiling and even swarm? Read MoreThat's exactly the kind of question roboticists like Zeynep Temel, an assistant professor of robotics at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, is asking -- and answering -- in her lab. Tiny robots would be useful in medical applications -- for targeted drug delivery or simple surgeries sans incisions, according to Temel. Miniature robots could also save lives in dangerous places like minefields, or during search and rescue: \"If you have small bug-robots,\" she said, it's possible to do \"more efficient -- and safer -- rescue operations\" following an avalanche or earthquake where it's dangerous for humans or even larger robots to tread.Small robots that can work together, like ants or bees do, would also be ideal for exploring other planets like Mars, again keeping humans away from risky, unexplored situations: \"I hope my research will be used to make modular robots that can self-assemble, to be used by astronauts in unknown environments to lend a helping hand,\" said Jamie Paik, founder and director of the Reconfigurable Robotics Lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. Shown here is the Reconfigurable Robotics Lab's concept use of a multifunctional, modular origami robot called Mori.These are just some of the important applications bio-inspired robots could be used for, and that's why roboticists at the worldwide major robotics labs are dedicated to exploring the class Insecta. Ants are a favorite inspiration -- they're able to lift bulky and heavier-than-they-are loads and travel quickly in sandy deserts as well as woodlands. These insects also work together to create bridges and surmount obstacles.Trap-jaw ants served as a model for a team that developed a battery-powered, palm-size robot that can \"adapt to an environment and can collaborate,\" Paik, a member of the team, said. In the natural world, trap-jaw ants do all the ant things \u2014 and they can also snap their powerful jaws at the incredible speed of 90 miles per hour to jump away from predators. Paik and her team used the same mechanics to help give the robots a variety of movements, including \"vertical jumping for height, horizontal jumping for distance, somersault jumping to clear obstacles, walking on textured terrain and crawling on flat surfaces,\" according to the paper's abstract.Like the ants they are based on, each unit is completely autonomous, but they can communicate and thereby work together via a simple transmitter. Another advantage to tiny, fairly simple autonomous robots? They're cheap, compared to a larger robot. \"We can throw out multiples of them, and if we lose or break some, they can still execute a given task,\" Paik said. Insect adaptations for high-tech solutionsWhy are insects such useful inspiration for roboticists? They give scientists a starting point, Paik said, that proves what's possible -- such as jumping 100 times their height like a flea, climbing vertical obstacles (or even upside down) or packing full-size wings under a petite hard shell like a ladybug. \"These are nature's optimized designs,\" she said. Temel backed up Paik's point -- while she said she's still a bit personally afraid of insects (the live ones), she has nonetheless come to admire how well they solve so many difficult problems. Talking robots could be used to combat loneliness and boost mental health in care homes \"They swim, they fly fast and know how to balance to perch, they walk and jump on the water's surface, and they can jump onto leaves which are like tiny, unstable platforms,\" Temel said. \"All these movements and motions that we are still trying to do in large-scale robotics and (insects) are doing it all -- and they are packing it all into such a small space.\" One of the biggest challenges for robots of all sizes is remaining upright on complex surfaces. \"Robots are good at smooth, but natural terrain is fascinatingly rough, and so it's difficult for robots,\" said Kathryn Daltorio, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Case Western Reserve University. Insects have six legs -- or two sets of tripods, thinking robotically -- which are great for stability. In addition to the multiple legs, they also utilize a variety of structures and materials to move across vertical surfaces, which Daltorio has studied and mimicked to create her very simple but successful climbing Mini-Whegs, which only have one motor. Roboticists designed this robot, called a Mini-Wheg, to mimic the walking behavior of a cockroach. Power and materialsOne thing humans can't replicate exactly (yet) are the unique materials grown or excreted by insects. Tiny claws, spines and sticky pads allow insects to perform their many feats. Daltorio was able to use human-made materials like Velcro, Scotch tape and craft spines on her Mini-Whegs, but other materials, like the lightweight, biodegradable hard exoskeletons are tougher to reproduce. For now, plastics and carbon fiber can serve to make inexpensive, easily produced exteriors, according to Daltorio. A technician gets ready to test a new robot in the water at Edgewater Beach in Cleveland.But not all insects are hard, and roboticists are now creating soft robots that can change shape to enable movement like caterpillars can, instead of relying on legs for every type of movement. A shape-memory alloy can be used that reacts to temperature, so a soft robot can curl and roll but \"remember\" a stiffer shape when heated. \"You can bend them, and apply a heat source, and they will bend back \u2014 we use those a lot,\" Temel said. Electricity can also be used to change the shapes of special piezoceramic materials. \"We apply voltage to bend them one direction or another, which is useful for cockroach-inspired robots,\" she says. Speaking of power, that's another challenge for tiny robots. Rechargeable batteries and solar panels are two popular solutions. The RoBeetle utilizes methanol to contract and expand its lab-designed \"muscles.\" Researchers have built a dog-like robot nurse to remotely measure patients' vital signsBut like the materials challenges, this is another area where roboticists work closely with colleagues who specialize in materials science, battery and solar technology to work toward autonomous robots. Building a robot is a collaborative endeavor, Temel said.   There is still a lot more research for roboticists to do before robots are as smart and agile as insects: \"Even a small fly has really smart reactions that are quick and able to respond to a lot of sensory information,\" Daltorio said. \"(Insects) have this very rich and adaptive behavioral repertoire that we can't yet get a robot to do.\" "

Talking robots could be used to combat loneliness and boost mental health in care homes \"They swim, they fly fast and know how to balance to perch, they walk and jump on the water's surface, and they can jump onto leaves which are like tiny, unstable platforms,\" Temel said. \"All these movements and motions that we are still trying to do in large-scale robotics and (insects) are doing it all -- and they are packing it all into such a small space.\" One of the biggest challenges for robots of all sizes is remaining upright on complex surfaces. \"Robots are good at smooth, but natural terrain is fascinatingly rough, and so it's difficult for robots,\" said Kathryn Daltorio, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Case Western Reserve University. Insects have six legs -- or two sets of tripods, thinking robotically -- which are great for stability. In addition to the multiple legs, they also utilize a variety of structures and materials to move across vertical surfaces, which Daltorio has studied and mimicked to create her very simple but successful climbing Mini-Whegs, which only have one motor. Roboticists designed this robot, called a Mini-Wheg, to mimic the walking behavior of a cockroach. Power and materialsOne thing humans can't replicate exactly (yet) are the unique materials grown or excreted by insects. Tiny claws, spines and sticky pads allow insects to perform their many feats. Daltorio was able to use human-made materials like Velcro, Scotch tape and craft spines on her Mini-Whegs, but other materials, like the lightweight, biodegradable hard exoskeletons are tougher to reproduce. For now, plastics and carbon fiber can serve to make inexpensive, easily produced exteriors, according to Daltorio. A technician gets ready to test a new robot in the water at Edgewater Beach in Cleveland.But not all insects are hard, and roboticists are now creating soft robots that can change shape to enable movement like caterpillars can, instead of relying on legs for every type of movement. A shape-memory alloy can be used that reacts to temperature, so a soft robot can curl and roll but \"remember\" a stiffer shape when heated. \"You can bend them, and apply a heat source, and they will bend back \u2014 we use those a lot,\" Temel said. Electricity can also be used to change the shapes of special piezoceramic materials. \"We apply voltage to bend them one direction or another, which is useful for cockroach-inspired robots,\" she says. Speaking of power, that's another challenge for tiny robots. Rechargeable batteries and solar panels are two popular solutions. The RoBeetle utilizes methanol to contract and expand its lab-designed \"muscles.\" Researchers have built a dog-like robot nurse to remotely measure patients' vital signsBut like the materials challenges, this is another area where roboticists work closely with colleagues who specialize in materials science, battery and solar technology to work toward autonomous robots. Building a robot is a collaborative endeavor, Temel said.   There is still a lot more research for roboticists to do before robots are as smart and agile as insects: \"Even a small fly has really smart reactions that are quick and able to respond to a lot of sensory information,\" Daltorio said. \"(Insects) have this very rich and adaptive behavioral repertoire that we can't yet get a robot to do.\" "

    "Description": " (CNN)Picture a robot. Did you envision a giant machine assembling cars, Data from \"Star Trek,\" C-3PO from \"Star Wars\" or \"The Terminator\"? Most of us would probably think of something massive -- or at least human size. But a whole arm of robotics is focusing on bug-size 'bots (and smaller). It's not just the size of tiny insects that are inspiring roboticists; it's also the many complex tasks and physical feats that comprise the everyday lives of many fleas, flies and other six-legged creatures. Meet the flying robot that can glide, flip and hoverThe question isn't only how big and powerful we can make a machine, but how small and savvy. What might humans be capable of if we could command a tiny army of simple machines? How could we use robots that could fly, skim across the water, hop to the ceiling and even swarm? Read MoreThat's exactly the kind of question roboticists like Zeynep Temel, an assistant professor of robotics at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, is asking -- and answering -- in her lab. Tiny robots would be useful in medical applications -- for targeted drug delivery or simple surgeries sans incisions, according to Temel. Miniature robots could also save lives in dangerous places like minefields, or during search and rescue: \"If you have small bug-robots,\" she said, it's possible to do \"more efficient -- and safer -- rescue operations\" following an avalanche or earthquake where it's dangerous for humans or even larger robots to tread.Small robots that can work together, like ants or bees do, would also be ideal for exploring other planets like Mars, again keeping humans away from risky, unexplored situations: \"I hope my research will be used to make modular robots that can self-assemble, to be used by astronauts in unknown environments to lend a helping hand,\" said Jamie Paik, founder and director of the Reconfigurable Robotics Lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. Shown here is the Reconfigurable Robotics Lab's concept use of a multifunctional, modular origami robot called Mori.These are just some of the important applications bio-inspired robots could be used for, and that's why roboticists at the worldwide major robotics labs are dedicated to exploring the class Insecta. Ants are a favorite inspiration -- they're able to lift bulky and heavier-than-they-are loads and travel quickly in sandy deserts as well as woodlands. These insects also work together to create bridges and surmount obstacles.Trap-jaw ants served as a model for a team that developed a battery-powered, palm-size robot that can \"adapt to an environment and can collaborate,\" Paik, a member of the team, said. In the natural world, trap-jaw ants do all the ant things \u2014 and they can also snap their powerful jaws at the incredible speed of 90 miles per hour to jump away from predators. Paik and her team used the same mechanics to help give the robots a variety of movements, including \"vertical jumping for height, horizontal jumping for distance, somersault jumping to clear obstacles, walking on textured terrain and crawling on flat surfaces,\" according to the paper's abstract.Like the ants they are based on, each unit is completely autonomous, but they can communicate and thereby work together via a simple transmitter. Another advantage to tiny, fairly simple autonomous robots? They're cheap, compared to a larger robot. \"We can throw out multiples of them, and if we lose or break some, they can still execute a given task,\" Paik said. Insect adaptations for high-tech solutionsWhy are insects such useful inspiration for roboticists? They give scientists a starting point, Paik said, that proves what's possible -- such as jumping 100 times their height like a flea, climbing vertical obstacles (or even upside down) or packing full-size wings under a petite hard shell like a ladybug. \"These are nature's optimized designs,\" she said.

    "Description": " (CNN)One of the Vatican's powerful cardinals has resigned from his post amid a growing financial scandal.Giovanni Angelo Becciu says he was accused of embezzlement and proclaimed his innocence during a press conference on Friday, the day after he was effectively fired by Pope Francis. Pope Francis celebrates the Pentecost mass on May 31, 2020 at St Peter's Basilica at the Vatican.Becciu served as the \"substitute\" in the Vatican's Secretariat of State, a powerful position similar to chief-of-staff, from 2011.The 72-year-old was created cardinal by Pope Francis in 2018 and made the head of the office which oversees canonizations of saints.Becciu's tenure came to an abrupt halt late Thursday night, when the Vatican announced in a brief communique that Pope Francis had accepted the cardinal's resignation. No further explanation was given by the Vatican.Read More\"Yesterday, until 6:02 p.m., I felt I was a friend of the Pope,\" Becciu said Friday at an impromptu press conference.\"Then he told me that he no longer trusts me because he was informed by the magistrates that I had committed embezzlement.\"A report says China is suspected of hacking the Vatican. Here's why Becciu claimed that Francis was visibly disturbed during the meeting. \"He asked me to renounce the privileges of being a cardinal,\" Becciu added.Despite the tense meeting with the Pope,  Becciu claimed that he will prove his innocence and is still \"ready to give his life\" for the Pontiff.Becciu said that he has not received any official notification of charges against him, but he understands that he is accused of using money from the Vatican to favor two of his brothers' businesses.The cardinal admitted that he transferred 100,000 euros ($116,000) to the Catholic charity, Caritas, in his native Sardinia, which has ties to one of his brother's companies, but said that the money was not given to his brother. Becciu also admitted that he gave money to another brother's window and door company for reconstruction works at Vatican Embassies in Angola and Cuba, but that the payment was approved by the Vatican.The Vatican bank has long been plagued by financial scandals. In 2013 Pope Francis set up an expert committee to recommend reforms to the economic and administrative structures of the Holy See, to combat the problem."

    "Description": "Paris (CNN)Two people were seriously injured in a knife attack Friday near the former offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, the site of a 2015 terrorist attack, the Paris police told CNN.The two victims are in a serious condition but their lives are not in danger, according to the police spokesperson. Police had previously said there were four people wounded in the attack Not long after the attack, a suspect was arrested near Place de la Bastille, in Paris's 11th district, but the person was not immediately identified by police. French prosecutors have opened up a terror investigation.\"The main perpetrator has been arrested and is currently in police custody. The second individual was placed in custody for his relations with the main perpetrator,\" Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Ricard, the national anti-terror prosecutor, said on Friday afternoon.Seven people in total have been arrested in connection to the attack, a judicial source told CNN on Friday. That number includes the two suspects Ricard discussed.Read MoreThe other five people were arrested at an apartment linked to the attack.\"Five people present during the search of an apartment likely to have been used by the main suspect were actually arrested and placed in custody,\" the source told CNN.     The two victims were on a cigarette break at the time when they were attacked, he added. The victims are employees of French documentary production company Premi\u00e8res Lignes, the firm's founder Paul Moreira told BFM TV. Moreira said it \"all happened very quickly\" and that \"a few blows were given to the two people in front of the office.\" Moreira said the victims were attacked with a \"sort of cleaver.\"Director of Premi\u00e8res Lignes Luc Hermann said on France Info TV: \"We're journalists. Our job is to inform, not to get attacked like this morning.\" He criticized what he described as a \"total absence of protection of this building since the attacks on Charlie Hebdo.\"Charlie Hebdo terror trial begins in Paris, five years after deadly attacksCharlie Hebdo offered its \"support and solidarity\" to their former neighbors and colleagues of Premieres Lignes, and \"to those affected by this heinous attack,\" in a statement on Facebook. Annie Hidalgo, mayor of Paris, tweeted a statement Friday condemning the attack. \"Through this highly symbolic place, it is once again freedom of expression that is targeted,\" Hidalgo said. \"We must remain vigilant and mobilized to defend this pillar of our Republic and protect our citizens.\"The attack comes amid a trial of suspects alleged to have been accomplices to a series of January 2015 terrorist attacks which began with a massacre at the Charlie Hebdo offices and ended with a siege at a kosher supermarket two days later.The suspects in the trial are accused of having provided logistical support to the perpetrators -- brothers Said and Ch\u00e9rif Kouachi, and their accomplice Amedy Coulibaly -- and face charges of participating in a terrorist criminal association.A total of 17 people were killed in the 2015 attacks, which took place in the French capital over three days.Twelve of those were murdered when the Kouachi brothers forced their way into the Charlie Hebdo building and opened fire during its editorial meeting on January 7.The victims included the magazine's editor, Stephane \"Charb\" Charbonnier, several cartoonists and columnists, and a protection officer assigned to protect Charb, who had been the target of threats over the magazine's publication, in 2006, of cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed. Soldiers patrol Paris after the knife attack.Police officers rush to the scene.The following day, January 8, policewoman Clarissa Jean-Philippe was shot dead by Coulibaly in the southern Paris suburb of Montrouge.On January 9, Coulibaly took several people hostage at a kosher superrmarket in the eastern Paris suburb of Porte de Vincennes. Four hostages were killed. Coulibaly was killed by police when they moved in to end the siege and rescue 15 other hostages.The Kouachi brothers were shot dead by police in a separate operation in Dammartin-en-Goele, northeast of Paris, the same day.To mark the start of the trial earlier this month, Charlie Hebdo republished the controversial cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed, along with a tribute to the employees who lost their lives in 2015.In a statement, the magazine described the cartoons as \"part of history, and one cannot rewrite history, neither can it be erased.\"A media group affiliated with al Qaeda had recently released a statement encouraging attacks on France, according to Site Intel and the Counter Extremism Project.Ga\u00eblle Fournier in Paris and Niamh Kennedy in London contributed to this report."

    "Description": " (CNN)When the next astronaut to reach the moon walks on the lunar surface in 2024, she'll face radiation levels 200 times higher than on Earth.While Apollo mission astronauts carried dosimeters to the moon to measure radiation, the data was never reported. The first systematically documented measurements of radiation on the moon were undertaken in January 2019 when China's Chang'e 4 robotic spacecraft mission landed on the far side of the Moon, according to a new study in the journal Science Advances.NASA outlines $28 billion plan to land the first woman on the Moon by 2024Astronauts on moon missions would experience an average daily radiation dose equivalent to 1,369 microsieverts per day -- about 2.6 times higher than the International Space Station crew's daily dose, the study said.Radiation is energy that is emitted in electromagnetic waves or particles. This includes visible light and heat (infrared radiation) that we can feel and others we can't, like X-rays and radio waves. However, astronauts face a number of potentially harmful radiation sources in space from which the Earth's atmosphere largely protects us.Read MoreMassive lava tubes on the moon and Mars could be used by astronauts These include galactic cosmic rays, sporadic solar particle events (when particles emitted by the sun become accelerated) and neutrons and gamma rays from interactions between space radiation and the lunar soil. \"The radiation levels we measured on the Moon are about 200 times higher than on the surface of the Earth and 5 to 10 times higher than on a flight from New York to Frankfurt,\" said Robert Wimmer-Schweingruber, a professor of physics at the University of Kiel in Germany and the corresponding author of the study that published Friday, in a statement.\"Because astronauts would be exposed to these radiation levels longer than passengers or pilots on transatlantic flights, this is a considerable exposure.\"  A risk of space travelRadiation exposure is one of the major risks for astronauts' health as the chronic exposure to galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) may induce cataracts, cancer or degenerative diseases of the central nervous system or other organ systems, the study said.China lunar rover touches down on far side of the moon, state media announce\"Moreover, exposure to large solar particle events in a situation with insufficient shielding may cause severe acute effects,\" the study added. Scientists at NASA describe radiation as one of five hazards of human space flight and the \"most menacing.\" On the Artemis moon mission, when the first woman will walk on the moon in 2024, the astronauts are expected to stay on the lunar surface for a week and conduct a minimum of two moonwalks.While astronauts have stayed on the International Space Station for a year,  the ISS sits just within Earth's protective magnetic field. This means that while astronauts are exposed to radiation levels 10 times higher than on Earth, it's a smaller dose than what deep space has in store.A Mars mission would likely take two to three years and a much higher dose of radiation.Deep space vehicles, NASA said, will sport protective shielding, dosimetry and alerts. Research is also being conducted into pharmaceuticals that could help defend against radiation, it added."

The instructors are all women.At the end of every Tools & Tiaras camp, Judaline Cassidy takes participants on a contruction site tour. \"If we make it more visible, more accessible, more women will jump on board and join the building trades.\"The power of toolsTanzira Rashid remembers attending her first Tools & Tiaras workshop at the age of 15. \"I'd never experienced anything like that. I saw so many tools around me and hard hats,\" Rashid said. \"I was never really exposed to construction when I was younger.\" Now, the scholar is headed to college to study civil engineering. \"Coming from first-generation Bengali immigrant parents, I was really pressured to either go into the medical field or become a lawyer because my parents sacrificed everything to come to the US. So, in their eyes, the only path to success was either becoming a doctor or a lawyer.\"Penelope Amaya, 13, chose to attend a STEM high school after participating in a Tools & Tiaras welding workshop.\"I fell in love with it right at the start. I want to be an architect or an engineer when I get older,\" Amaya excitedly shared. Tools & Tiaras showed me that women can do anything.\"13-year-old Penelope Amaya chose to attend a STEM high school after participating in a Tools & Tiaras workshop.Because of the coronavirus pandemic, Tools & Tiaras made this year's camp virtual.

They are the magic,\" Cassidy said. \"To see their faces all lit up when they know that they can use a power drill, it gives me a high. I call the girls 'princess warriors' because I believe women are very strong and we are also very elegant.\"Inspiration in Trinidad and Tobago Cassidy grew up on the beautiful twin islands of Trinidad and Tobago with a houseful of cousins and a great grandmother as their caretaker. \"I grew up really poor, but at the same time, it was filled with music and laughter,\" Cassidy recalled. \"I started Tools & Tiaras because I didn't have a mother or father. I grew up not having any self-confidence in myself. I had some, but not a lot, and I didn't want any little girl to grow up feeling that way.\"Judaline Cassidy started her career at technical institute in Trinidad and Tobago. She was one of three women accepted into the plumbling program.The Trinidadian was not exposed to the trades until high school. \"I literally got kicked out of typing class because I struggled with typing and was put into the technical drawing class,\" Cassidy said with a laugh. So that was my precursor for plumbing without even knowing it.\"But when her great-grandmother passed, she couldn't afford to attend a university. So, she opted for a free education and applied to trade school.\"I chose plumbing like this\u2014I said 'plumbing, you get wet, and electrical, you get shocked. Plumbing here I come!'\"Now, Cassidy travels as a speaker, spreading the importance of the trades with others. Judaline Cassidy speaks onstage during The 2017 MAKERS Conference on February 7, 2017 in Rancho Palos Verdes, California. \"My mission is to really just put tools in girls' hands and let them build the world that they so desire.\""

    "Description": "Roughly 80 million years ago in the shallow inland sea that once split North America into eastern and western land masses, a fearsome 10-meter-long (33-foot-long) marine reptile with powerful jaws and tremendous bite-force was one of the apex predators.A type of seagoing lizard called a mosasaur that ruled the oceans at the same time dinosaurs dominated the land, it has now been given a name meaning \"Jaws of Death.\"A new analysis published on Wednesday of fossils of the creature unearthed in 1975 has determined that it deserves to be recognized as a new genus of mosasaur based on skeletal traits including a unique combination of features in the tooth-bearing bones and the shape of an important bone in the jaw joint.'Blood amber' may be a portal into dinosaur times, but the fossils are an ethical minefield for palaeontologists\nIts remains were discovered near Cedaredge, Colorado.This Cretaceous Period creature previously had been classified as the species Prognathodon stadtmani. Because of its differences from other species of Prognathodon, Joshua Lively, curator of paleontology at the Utah State University Eastern Prehistoric Museum, gave it the new scientific name Gnathomortis stadtmani.Read MoreGnathomortis is derived from the Greek and Latin words for \"Jaws of Death.\"After other marine reptiles like ichthyosaurs and pliosaurs went extinct, mosasaurs terrorized the oceans.\"In general, mosasaurs actually filled a lot of roles in the oceans over the last 15 million years of the age of dinosaurs,\" Lively said. \"Some specialized in eating clams, some were fish specialists, and others were clearly macropredators that could devour anything smaller than them. This mosasaur was one of the latter.\"Oldest animal sperm discovered in 100-million-year-old amber\"If you were an animal in the oceans less than 6 meters (20 feet) in length, you are most likely on the menu for Gnathomortis,\" added Lively, whose study was published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.That menu, Lively said, may have included sea turtles, fish, sharks and other marine reptiles including smaller mosasaurs.Like other mosasaurs and many lizards and snakes, it boasted an extra set of teeth on the roof of its mouth.A large depression on the outer surface of its lower jaws is indicative of large muscles that gave it tremendous bite-force. While it lived alongside even-larger mosasaurs like 46-foot-long (14-meter-long) Tylosaurus in the Western Interior Seaway that ran from present-day Canada to Mexico, Gnathomortis had stronger jaws.\"'Jaws of Death' seemed appropriate for this kind of critter,\" Lively said, \"and it turns out to be an awesome name.\""

    "Description": " (CNN)A British teenager has staged a protest against climate change inside the Arctic Circle. In the world's most northerly climate strike, Mya-Rose Craig, a passionate ornithologist and nature, climate and equal rights campaigner, was photographed protesting on an ice floe at the Arctic ice edge, north of Svalbard, at 82.2\u00b0 North earlier this week.  The 18-year-old, who lives near the southwestern English city of Bristol, held up a placard saying \"Youth Strike for Climate.\" She spent five hours on the ice, a spokesperson for environmental organization Greenpeace told CNN.Craig, who says on her Twitter page that she is the youngest person to have seen half the world's birds, arrived in the Arctic on board the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise as part of an expedition documenting the impact of the climate crisis and investigating marine life in the region.Greta Thunberg will donate $114,000 to fight the coronavirus in the Brazilian AmazonThe journey, which started from Norway in early September, was timed to coincide with next week's United Nations Summit on Biodiversity, where \"marine protection should be front and center to any discussions about protecting biodiversity,\" Greenpeace said in a statement. Craig spent five on the ice.Read MoreSeptember 25 has been declared a global climate action day by Fridays for Future, a global strike movement that started in August 2018, when Greta Thunberg, then aged 15, launched her climate protest.In a statement issued by Greenpeace, Craig said: \"I'm here because I want to see for myself what's at stake as this crucial protector of the planet, the Arctic Ocean, melts away at a terrifying rate. Today, myself and Fridays For Future activists from all over the world are standing up to call for urgent action against climate breakdown. The young conservatives who believe Greta Thunberg and want to bring Republicans with them\"I'm here to demand that our leaders come together and create ocean sanctuaries to protect this essential but fragile place and at least 30 per cent of our oceans. There is still time to turn things around towards more sustainable energies and lifestyles, and that moment must be now.\"Craig said the trip brought home to her how urgent the issue of climate change is.Craig told CNN that the trip had been a \"once in a lifetime experience,\" in more ways than one. \"It feels like a once in a lifetime experience, not only because it has been an amazing trip, but also because I am hyper-aware that the Arctic is disappearing. \"I have been a climate activist for years but now it has really sunk in just how urgent this issue is. \"Looking out from the ship it was so easy to picture it all slowly melting and disappearing in the coming two decades.\"A chunk of ice twice the size of Manhattan has broken off Greenland in the last two yearsEarlier this week, scientists from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) at the University of Colorado Boulder said the Arctic sea ice, or the floating ice cover of the Arctic Ocean, had reached its minimum extent for the year, shrinking to the second lowest extent since record-keeping began in 1978.Craig, who has just finished high school, is taking a year out before studying politics and international relations at university next year. According to Greenpeace, she is one of millions of youth activists and climate strikers demanding action and accountability from global leaders in \"tackling the commodification of nature for profit.\" Earlier this year she shared a platform with Thunberg, addressing 40,000 people in Bristol. A Greenpeace team is in the Arctic to document the impact of the climate crisis and investigate marine life in the region.On why young people like herself and Thunberg are demonstrating, she told CNN: \"I really wanted to convey how, as a young person, I feel incredibly desperate about this issue and I feel it's extremely urgent. \"It makes me really angry when politicians and world leaders don't take action on climate change -- it isn't their future that's melting down the drain. \"This movement of young people has been so exciting to me. It has the potential to be revolutionary because protests and strikes like this are finally giving young people a voice. People are finally sitting down and listening to us about how we feel about our future.\"Teen Vogue's August issue tackles voter suppressionPosting on Facebook earlier Friday, Craig wrote: \"It has taken me weeks to travel by road and boat to the Arctic edge to bear witness to the Sea Ice Minimum, the lowest level of the ice at the end of each summer. Today, I took part in the most northerly Youth Strike ever, to bear witness to the low ice level and ask you to amplify my voice and those of other young people around the world and demand that our leaders take action now when they meet at the UN General Assembly soon.\""

Magawa at work detecting landmines.Magawa is larger than your average pet rat -- but still light enough he would never set off a landmine by walking over it, the way human de-miners might.In seven years, he has discovered 39 landmines and 28 items of unexploded ordnance, helping clear more than 141,000 square meters (nearly 35 acres) of land, according to PDSA -- making him the charity's best performing rat.\"Magawa is a hero rat. We're thrilled to celebrate his life-saving devotion by awarding him the PDSA gold medal,\" PDSA's Director General Jan McLouglin said in a virtual presentation of the medal, which was specially designed to fit on Magawa's work harness.The PDSA Gold Medal, part of the organization's Animal Awards program, is \"the highest honor for outstanding animal bravery and exceptional dedication in civilian life,\" according to its website.African giant pouched rats are intelligent and easy to train, according to the press release; Magawa began training from a young age, and \"passed all his tests with flying colors\" before being deployed to Cambodia.He has been trained to ignore scrap metal lying about, and signals to his handler when he detects a landmine's exact location.

The US alone dropped 2.7 million tons of ordnance -- including cluster bombs and submunitions -- over a four-year carpet-bombing campaign in Cambodia. Up to a quarter of the cluster bombs failed to explode, meaning they stayed active and dangerous but out of sight, according to a 2019 report by the US Congressional Research Service.Then, after the fall of the Khmer Rouge, the ensuing civil war and Vietnamese invasion saw more landmines laid across the country. The PDSA estimates that there are still three million unexploded landmines in Cambodia. Some reports estimate that only half the country's land has been cleared so far, according to the congressional report."

    "Description": "Seoul, South Korea (CNN)North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has apologized for the death of a South Korean government worker who was shot dead by North Korean troops after crossing a maritime border between the two countries.  In a letter sent to South Korea's Blue House Friday morning, North Korea said units responded to a call that an unidentified male was found floating on an object in the sea. The letter claims about 10 rounds were fired at the man after he did not comply with a soldier's demand to identify himself and subsequent warning shots.North Korea says only a pool of blood remained on the floating object after the shots were fired. After soldiers presumed the man to be dead, they burned the floating object on site per North Korea's Covid-19 disease prevention measures.  \"Chairman Kim Jong Un asked to convey that he feels very sorry that instead of giving aid to our compatriots in the South who is struggling with Covid epidemic, we have given President Moon and our compatriots in the South a great disappointment with this unseen misfortune in our sea,\" the letter read, according to the Blue House. The statement added that North Korea has strengthened its maritime surveillance and apologized for \"an incident that will clearly negatively impact inter-Korean relation.\"Read MoreApologies from Kim are rare, especially when it comes to apparent mistakes by the country's military.According to Lt. Gen. Ahn Young-ho, a top official with South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, a worker with the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries went missing in waters 1.9 kilometers (1.2 miles) south of the Yeonpyeong Islands on September 21.South Korean defense officials previously said they believed the man was in the process of attempting to defect to North Korea. In a statement Thursday, the South Korean military said it \"strongly condemns the North's atrocities\" and urged Pyongyang to provide an explanation and punish those responsible.Tensions have been rising between North and South Korea since communication between the two sides was cut off in June, when Pyongyang first closed and then blew up a joint liaison office in Kaesong, a city on the northern side of the border. The deterioration in relations came after a years-long rapprochement led by South Korean President Moon Jae-in resulted in historic meetings between himself and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, as well as summits between Kim and US President Donald Trump. But those meetings ultimately did not deliver significant results for all sides, and North Korea has taken an increasingly strident tone towards its southern neighbor, a shift in stance that has come as Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, moved into a more influential position in the North Korean regime.Speaking Thursday, South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-hwa said that the offer of dialogue towards North Korea remains open, and Seoul is ready to engage with Pyongyang. In the weeks prior to the shooting, Kim had exchanged letters with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, the Blue House said."

    "Description": " (CNN)China's Ambassador to the United Nations said Thursday that the US has \"created enough troubles for the world already\" as the two nations continued to spar over the coronavirus pandemic during a tense meeting of the UN Security Council.US Representative to the UN Kelly Craft criticized China over what she said was a \"decision to hide the origins of this virus, minimize its danger, and suppress scientific cooperation.\" Craft claimed Beijing's actions \"transformed a local epidemic into a global pandemic.\"China's Zhang Jun swiftly rejected Craft's characterization of events.\"I must say, enough is enough. You have created enough troubles for the world already,\" Zhang said.\"Regrettably, we have once again heard noises from the US that are so at odds with the atmosphere of the meeting.\" Read MoreContrast couldn't be greater between Trump and Xi at the UN, but Chinese leader is the true authoritarianZhang added that Beijing rejected the \"baseless\" accusations.The spat came two days after US President Donald Trump used much of his pre-recorded video address to the General Assembly to blame China for the Covid-19 pandemic and for withholding information about the virus.On Tuesday, Trump accused Beijing of \"allowing flights to leave China and infect the world\" and referred to Covid-19 as the \"China virus\" on Tuesday.On Thursday, Zhang said the US had only itself to blame. Since January, the US has diagnosed more than 6 million coronavirus cases in its population, and lost more than 200,000 lives to the illness.The Russian representative at the Thursday session also criticized Craft's accusations.\"We regret the fact that the representative of the United States chose this meeting and the platform of the UN Security Council to make unfounded accusation against one of the members of the Security Council,\"  said Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia. Covid-19 has loomed heavily over this year's summit, which was forced online due to the pandemic and the 14-day quarantine regulations in New York City.UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has repeatedly pleaded for unity between member states and warned on Thursday that the relationship between the US and China was moving \"in a very dangerous direction.\" Thursday's Security Council meeting was held virtually."

    "Description": "CNN has partnered with the Imperial War Museum in London on \"Life in a Camp,\" a special installation about the Moria refugee camp in Lesbos, Greece. Actor Lena Headey, who has visited Moria, has written an op-ed to coincide with the exhibit's opening. Headey has previously collaborated with the International Rescue Committee to bring attention to the European refugee crisis. She portrayed Cersei Lannister on the HBO TV series \"Game of Thrones.\" (CNN)Moria. It was hell on Earth. Unclean, unsafe. Human rights didn't exist.I visited this sprawling \"reception center\" for refugees on the Greek island of Lesbos twice, in 2016 and again in 2019. By my second visit, the situation at the camp seemed to have reached new heights of desperation. Moria had already doubled its intended capacity and continued to grow each day, reaching six times its limit.Lena HeadeyOn both visits I witnessed the intake of new people of all ages, including the elderly and young children. You would think these people were criminals, not human beings who had fled from war and endless, brutal threat.Some of them spent months sleeping on makeshift cots with only silver blankets for warmth and comfort.There was no room. People were packed in, sharing space with complete strangers. Blankets were used as walls to offer some privacy.Read MoreThe toilets were a disgrace. Running water was often shut off. There was no lighting at night. Women were too scared to leave their tents, afraid to leave their children alone. There was a persistent threat of sexual violence.The simplest of day-to-day needs were not met. Getting food meant queuing for hours, only to receive the most inadequate meal you can imagine. Some simply chose to stay away, avoid the violence and starve.Being stuck in limbo, in such appalling living conditions and with no certainty about the future, had an alarming effect on the mental health of people who have been living in Moria; as an advocate for mental health, what I saw on Lesbos resonated deeply. People gather around a fire for warmth in the Moria refugee camp in Lesbos, Greece in February 2020.A report by the International Rescue Committee (IRC) last year revealed that over 60% of refugees treated at the IRC's mental health center in Moria had considered suicide, with 30% having already attempted it. Looking into the eyes of someone who has lost all hope is something you can never forget. You could feel the incendiary nature of that place. Fury and loss and despair -- unprotected, unsupported and uncertain about their futures. Mothers staring into the distance, hope gone, as if they couldn't even see their own children in front of them.The hell hole that was Moria has now burnt to the ground. But the crisis isn't going away. People continue to arrive every week on the shores of Greece and elsewhere needing protection; people who need shelter, food, love and recognition.I met some extraordinary people in Moria, who were hugely inspiring. They need some hope. Why is it so difficult for us to offer this?A woman stands outside her tent in the Moria refugee camp in Lesbos, Greece in February 2020. The fire and the subsequent chaos, the loss of the few possessions these people had, that tiny thread of stability, is utterly heartbreaking; yet maybe, maybe it will move this forward.This problem needs a sustainable solution. We need to offer education and infrastructure, we need to give the opportunity for people to contribute, to be part of something. There should be sincere, significant efforts to improve services and facilities on the ground for refugees -- and a serious, humane effort to both expand legal pathways into Europe and share responsibility across the continent. After the fire, both France and Germany said they'd take in more refugees from Lesbos. But one thing is abundantly clear. Greece cannot shoulder this alone. The European Union needs to step up. "

    "Description": " (CNN)Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declared Wednesday that a second wave of the coronavirus is already underway in most of Canada.  \"We're on the brink of a fall that could be much worse than the spring,\" Trudeau said during a rare address to the nation. \"I know this isn't the news that any of us wanted to hear and we can't change today's numbers or even tomorrow's. Those were already decided by what we did or didn't do 2 weeks ago. \"It's all too likely we won't be gathering for Thanksgiving but we still have a shot at Christmas. Together we have the power to get this second wave under control,\" he said telling Canadians they have the ability to flatten the pandemic curve once again. Canada's Thanksgiving falls on October 12.The exponential growth of new cases is now of grave concern to public health officials trying to avoid a second lockdown. Read MorePublic Health Agency of Canada reported a near tripling of cases in the last five weeks, with young people under the age of 40 contributing the majority of cases. \"Canada is at a crossroads with the Covid-19 epidemic trajectory,\" Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam said in a statement Wednesday. \"Unless public health and individual protective measures are strengthened and we work together to slow the spread of the virus, the situation is on track for a big resurgence in a number of provinces.\"The health agency reported Thursday that the national daily case count continues to increase, with an average of 1,144 cases reported daily during the past seven days. That average was just 380 in mid-August. Dr. Tam emphasized that Canadians can still prevent a rapid resurgence of the virus. \"As I have said, local public health authorities cannot do this alone, individual actions to prevent exposure  and limit the number of close contacts are a must. This is not simply a matter of resources, it is a reality of the current level of accelerated growth,\" she said in a statement.  'Not a time for austerity'The Trudeau government and several provincial leaders have indicated that targeted restrictions may be needed but they fear a second lockdown could put a fragile economic recovery in jeopardy. Earlier Wednesday, Trudeau's government delivered its Speech from the Throne, designed to set out its priorities for the upcoming parliamentary session. The prime minister outlined a pandemic response with the mantra, \"This is not a time for austerity.\" Trudeau promised to create a million jobs for Canadians through a mix of programs including subsidizing wages, skills retraining and incentives for businesses to hire new employees, especially in environmentally focused sectors.  In addition, Trudeau said he will continue to provide income support for the unemployed, including making it easier to qualify for unemployment and a new benefit for those who do not qualify. He also promised to help provinces now facing challenges with testing, long-term health care for seniors and school reopenings. Canada has reported more than 150,000 cases of Covid-19 with 9,295 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins global tracker."

    "Description": "London (CNN)At first glance, the outlook doesn't seem too grim. While reported coronavirus cases are reaching record highs as Europe endures a \"second wave,\" deaths are still well below their peak in April.But experts warn the signs point to more tragedy ahead this winter.Europe's hospitals are now better equipped for treating Covid-19. Measures such as social distancing and mask-wearing have become the norm and the latest spread of infection has been primarily among younger people, who are less likely to die if they contract the virus. Yet colder weather is beginning to set in and the flu season is approaching. The infection is spreading to older populations, and there are signs that people are growing tired of adhering to the restrictions.     \"Obviously we don't really have any ways of preventing Covid from going around, other than the lockdowns or social distancing measures and so on; we don't yet have a vaccine,\" Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the UK's University of Southampton, told CNN.Read MoreWhile he does not expect deaths to reach the levels seen in the first wave, Head added: \"We'll see a lot of spread of cases, we will see a lot of hospitalizations, and a lot of burden on our health service. \"There will also be a big death toll.\"From young to oldCoronavirus cases reported across Europe reached a record high of 52,418 over a rolling seven-day average on Tuesday, according to CNN analysis of Johns Hopkins University data. But there were just 556 new deaths reported, compared with a height of 4,134 daily fatalities (from 31,852 cases) from the seven-day average on April 10. That compares with a seven-day average of 44,547 cases and 722 deaths on Tuesday in North America, which has a population of 366 million compared with Europe's 750 million people. Hospitals are now better able to diagnose and treat the virus, meaning mortality rates for ICU patients in some European countries have dropped from about 50% during the spring to roughly 20%, Head estimates. But Bulgaria, Croatia, Malta, Romania and Spain have all been seeing sustained death rate increases.Students wait for a train to university, during rush hour in Barcelona, Spain, on Thursday.In the first week of September, the biggest proportion of new cases was still among 25- to 49-year-olds, according to the World Health Organization's Europe director, Hans Kluge. But there was also a rise in cases in older groups, aged 50 to 79.Head warned that the uptick in cases \"will at some point translate into infections in older populations who have higher mortality rates.\"\"We are seeing rates of cases in older populations and vulnerable populations increasing again across all European countries,\" he said. \"So it's a very predictable pattern actually, that across the UK and France or Spain we've seen younger populations being affected, and then about four to six weeks later ... we're starting to see elderly people being infected.\"The final stage of the Tour de France races down Paris' Champs Elysees on Sunday.Head added that more cases in the community means more opportunities for the virus to get into institutions such as care homes, with \"a big increase in care home outbreaks here in the UK, over the last month or so.\"Burden on hospitalsThe arrival of the flu season is also a \"huge concern\" because of the potential burden on health services, Head said. France, which reported its highest daily rise in case numbers of 13,498 last Saturday, saw the number of people in intensive care rise 25% last week.Deaths are not the only problem. The pressure on hospitals is also increased by the number of \"long-haulers,\" those who are suffering adverse effects from coronavirus more than a month after they were ill. \"Even in younger fitter people, we're still seeing about 10 to 20% who are having longer-term consequences beyond the initial infection,\" said Head.People sit outside in Chinatown, central London, on Saturday. The UK has introduced a 10 p.m. curfew for pubs and restaurants.He said this would mean \"further stresses on the health services over the next few months and indeed for years to come.\"Peter Drobac, a global health physician and director at Oxford University's Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship, told CNN it would be \"irresponsible\" if Europe allowed the death rate to get back to April's levels.He said that while \"we haven't detected any kind of seasonal pattern with this particular virus,\" the real risk is that the cold weather could force people back indoors, where transmission is more likely.While most countries now have greater testing capacity, Drobac said \"increased testing does not explain the rise in cases that we're seeing in most settings\" since we're also seeing a higher percentage of tests coming back positive. \"It's clear we're losing control of this,\" he said.\"We know enough about how the virus behaves -- how it's transmitted, how to control it, how to treat it when people do get infected -- that we should be able to make sure the second wave of infections isn't devastatingly large, because that's ultimately what's going to lead to a larger death toll, it's when health systems start to get overwhelmed.\"'The perfect storm'The approach to the second wave of infections varies across Europe. Leaders are trying to balance protecting public health with avoiding catastrophic economic damage from national lockdowns.Spain reported a record 14,389 daily cases last Friday. In Madrid, which accounts for a third of its cases, residents in 37 areas are only allowed to leave their homes to go to work, school or for medical reasons, and parks and playgrounds were closed from Monday. Military tents erected for hospital patients at the Gomez Ulla military hospital in Madrid, Spain, on Friday.The UK, which reported its highest case number since April on Wednesday, has restricted gatherings to six people and will close pubs and restaurants at 10 p.m. The Czech Republic, which reported a record number of coronavirus infections on Friday, reintroduced indoor mask requirements earlier this month.\"The bottom line is the second wave is here in many countries in Europe already,\" said Drobac. \"Our actions in the next couple of weeks, and throughout the winter, are going to be critical to stemming the spread but if we don't get a handle on it soon, particularly in places like the UK, Spain and France at the moment, we will certainly see a surge in deaths.\"A lab assistant organizes samples for Covid-19 tests at a laboratory in Neuilly-sur-Seine, outside Paris, on September 15.Drobac said Europe once again needs to \"flatten the curve\" through social distancing and hygiene measures as well as robust testing and contact tracing.He believes it is \"unlikely\" countries will return to the full national lockdowns that were a common approach in the spring, in part because of public resistance or fatigue with restrictions. \"I think it'll be hard to get political and public support for it. I think it'll be hard to enforce and people are tired,\" he said.\"In many ways, we think winter could be a perfect storm. That's why I wish we could have used our summer a lot better, to really crush the virus and make sure we were in better position for it.\""

    "Description": "A version of this story appeared in the September 24 edition of CNN's Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction newsletter. Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday. (CNN)The pandemic could have been the decisive moment in the fight against climate change -- an opportunity for leaders to bail out the environment and pivot the planet toward a greener future.Instead, CNN has found that some of the biggest fossil fuel-producing countries are injecting taxpayer money into propping up polluting industries. And exclusive new data shows these decisions are taking the world a step closer to a climate catastrophe.\"This is the one chance that we have,\" said professor Niklas H\u00f6hne, founding partner at the NewClimate Institute, a climate think tank, and co-author of an upcoming study from the Climate Action Tracker shared with CNN.The research shows that the world is running well behind its already insufficient targets of limiting global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees.The United Nations says it is necessary to phase out fossil fuels to stop catastrophic man-made climate change. But getting rid of them is going to be hard. Below, we look at four parts of the world once again turning to fossil fuels to help salvage their economies.Read MoreYOU ASKED. WE ANSWEREDQ: Did coronavirus lockdowns put a lasting dent in our collective carbon footprint?A: The short answer: No. Global greenhouse gas emissions have fallen due to coronavirus lockdowns and current economic downturn means future emissions are projected to be slightly lower. But the recent decline won't have any real impact on long-term climate change, according to exclusive data from the Climate Action Tracker. Global emissions are still higher than nations promised under international agreements. And much higher than they need to be to limit catastrophic climate change.Send your questions here.

WHERE THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND CORONAVIRUS CONVERGEPoland is spending $35 million to buy up unwanted coal to relieve an industry \"shaken by the pandemic\"Civil engineer Piotr Pupin has been working at the Tur\u00f3w lignite mine in southwestern Poland for the past 19 years. And just like his father did, he hopes to continue working there until it's time to retire.He's got a problem. While the open pit mine holds enough coal to continue operations until 2044, its current permit is set to expire in just six years. And because of the climate crisis, there's plenty of opposition in the European Union to further extensions.But Poland is fiercely resisting the calls for a rapid phaseout of coal. The country is the only EU member state refusing to pledge carbon neutrality by 2050.And now, the Polish government is propping up the increasingly uneconomical industry by buying up unwanted coal and banning imports of cheaper coal.The Tur\u00f3w lignite mine in southwestern Poland.In Canada, the province of Alberta is investing $1.1 billion into a new oil pipeline, deemed \"essential\" for economic recoveryShawn \"Big John\" McDonald was born and raised on the Kikino Metis settlement in Alberta, a piece of land set aside for the local aboriginal population. He got into the oil and gas industry straight after school. For McDonald, developing the area's oil sands is a logical continuation of his ancestors' traditions -- and a way to support the community's interests.The local government in Alberta agrees with McDonald. It is now pumping money into the oil and gas sector, hoping to speed up the recovery from the coronavirus crisis. It has invested 1.5 billion Canadian dollars ($1.1 billion) in the Keystone XL pipeline -- an investment it says will support the economy and create 7,000 jobs. But critics of the choice say the decision to pour taxpayers' money into the project ignores the impacts of climate change already being experienced in Alberta, as well as Canada's commitments to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.Australia's Queensland is fast-tracking a new coal mine to help the state \"bounce back from the impacts of Covid-19\"There's a saying about Australians and coal: To find out what people think, you need to draw a horizontal line across the country, somewhere just north of Sydney. For those who live above the line, coal equals the economy and jobs. For those below it, it's all about climate change.Australia is the world's second biggest coal exporter after Indonesia, and Queensland in particular relies heavily on the resources sector. When the economy suffered a major hit because of the pandemic this spring, the Queensland government quickly stepped in to provide relief for the all-important sector. The package included rent waivers, new exploration incentives and the capping and waiving of charges and fees. Then, in June, the state government decided to fast-track a new coal mine in the Bowen Basin, a 1.5 billion Australian dollar ($1.1 billion) project.Plans for the new mine have been met with criticism by climate groups, who say they make an \"absolute mockery\" of its pledges to limit coal mining because of climate change.India is opening up dozens of coal mines to the private sector to \"turn the Covid-19 crisis into an opportunity\"The dense jungles of Hasdeo Arand, in India's central Chhattisgarh state, are home to endangered species and the Gondi, one of India's original indigenous tribes. It is also the site of an estimated 5 billion metric tons of coal, which the mining industry is keen to tap into.The Gondis' long fight to save the forest, and their way of life, from destruction has just gotten more complicated.With the aim of making India \"self-reliant,\" boosting the economy wrecked by the coronavirus pandemic and getting thousands of people back to work, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced in June that 41 new \"coal blocks\" across five states would be opened up to commercial mining.While five sensitive mining locations in the Hasdeo Arand were eventually withdrawn from Modi's list, the threat to the forest hasn't subsided. And the push for more coal mining also has the potential to divert India from its global commitments to reduce emissions at a time where the country is reeling from extreme weather and water shortages linked to the climate crisis.ON OUR RADARJohnson & Johnson's one-dose coronavirus vaccine has become the fourth to enter phase 3 trials in the US.   Dr. Anthony Fauci says a \"large proportion\" of the US will not be vaccinated for Covid-19 this year.   President Donald Trump claimed that the White House can overrule the US Food and Drug Administration's attempt to toughen guidelines for a vaccine.   The CDC said thousands of commercial flight passengers may have been exposed to Covid-19 since the start of 2020.   Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declared Wednesday that a second wave is already underway in most of Canada.   The United Kingdom is considering \"human challenge trials\" -- testing vaccines on volunteers deliberately infected with Covid-19.  France placed restrictions on bars and restaurants following a surge in cases.   Modi has asked states in India to reduce Covid-19 restrictions and focus on restarting the economy.   Israel has announced a significant tightening of restrictions during its second general lockdown, including strict limits on protests and prayer groups and a wider closure of places of work.   TODAY'S TOP TIPIn the wars against the coronavirus and the climate crisis, we have met the enemy and the enemy is us. Such is the sentiment of virologists and climatologists alike as they point out how much the pandemic can teach us about the fight for the survival of life on Earth.

    "Description": "Seoul (CNN)A South Korean government worker was shot dead after crossing a maritime border into North Korea, Seoul said Thursday.  According to Lt. Gen. Ahn Young-ho, a top official with South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, a worker with the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries went missing in waters 1.9 kilometers (1.2 miles) south of the Yeonpyeong Islands on September 21. A Defense Ministry official told reporters that a vessel belonging to North Korea's fishery organization first discovered the missing South Korean in the sea near the islands. The man was on a piece of flotsam large enough to support one person, was wearing a life jacket and was exhausted, the spokesman said. The South Korean is thought to have being in the process of defecting to North Korea, and the Defense Ministry official said a member of the North Korean vessel's crew, believed to be wearing a gas mask, listened to the man making a testimony to that effect. Later, a North Korean patrol vessel opened fire on the attempted defector, who was killed. Following this, a soldier in a gas mask and hazard suit approached the body and burned it.

According to Unification Ministry spokesman Yoh Sang-key, the incident \"throws cold water on our consistent patience and effort for inter-Korean reconciliation and peace and it goes directly against our people's yearning for peace on Korean Peninsula.\"Tensions have been rising between North and South Korea since communication between the two sides was cut off in June, when Pyongyang first closed and then blew up a joint liaison office in Kaesong, a city on the northern side of the border.
